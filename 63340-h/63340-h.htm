<p  class="p2">Nick Carter stands for an interesting detective story. The
fact that the books in this line are so uniformly good is entirely
due to the work of a specialist. The man who wrote
these stories produced no other type of fiction. His mind was
concentrated upon the creation of new plots and situations in
which his hero emerged triumphantly from all sorts of trouble,
and landed the criminal just where he should be—behind the
bars.</p>

<p>The author of these stories knew more about writing detective
stories than any other single person.</p>

<p>Following is a list of the best Nick Carter stories. They have
been selected with extreme care, and we unhesitatingly recommend
each of them as being fully as interesting as any detective
story between cloth covers which sells at ten times the price.</p>

<p>If you do not know Nick Carter, buy a copy of any of the
New Magnet Library books, and get acquainted. He will surprise
and delight you.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER I.
<br />
<small>A DARK NIGHT’S WORK.</small></h2>


<p>“Your uncle murdered! It seems incredible!”</p>

<p>Nick Carter leaned back in his chair and looked
at his visitor, dismay showing in his face.</p>

<p>“It is too true, old friend, Uncle Alvin was murdered
in his bed last night, and diamonds to the
value of half a million dollars stolen from the
house.”</p>

<p>The speaker, Charley Maynard, was greatly
excited. He was a young man who had arrived
at legal age only a few months before. Almost
from boyhood he had been a friend of the man
of whom he now sought sympathy and advice.</p>

<p>“Half a million in diamonds!” echoed the detective.
“I was not aware that Alvin Maynard
possessed diamonds to that value.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“They were mine,” replied the young man.</p>

<p>“The day is full of surprises,” said Nick.
“When and how did you become owner of such
a wonderful collection of precious stones?”</p>

<p>“They were delivered to me yesterday, at the
residence of my uncle, up the Hudson,” replied
Charley. “I heartily wish I had never set eyes
on them.”</p>

<p>“A present?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“My inheritance from my father,” was the
reply. “As you know, he was a globe trotter
from his youth up. It seems that during a visit
to South Africa he became the possessor of the
gems which were stolen last night. How he came
by them I have no idea. I only know that there
are some very fine stones in the collection, and
that they were delivered to me yesterday afternoon.
Now they are gone, my uncle lies dead in
the house, my aunt is prostrated with grief, besides
suffering severely from a blow dealt by a
brutal assassin, and my cousin, Anton Sawtelle,
lies wounded in his bed. It is a sad house this
morning, Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p>“There was a struggle, then?” asked Nick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
“The robbers were discovered at their work and
fought for the booty?”</p>

<p>“That is the strangest part of the case,” said
the young man. “The diamonds were stolen from
a trunk in my room on the second floor of the
house, and yet I heard nothing of the struggle
which must have taken place. It seems that the
burglars entered by way of Anton’s room and
searched the entire floor. Why they should have
visited the apartments of my uncle and aunt is
more than I can understand. I am not a heavy
sleeper, yet I heard nothing of the affair until this
morning.”</p>

<p>“Was no one able to give the alarm until this
morning?” asked Nick. “Where were the servants?
Surely they must have been aroused.”</p>

<p>“They were not,” was the reply, “and the first
intimation I had of the murder of my uncle and
the loss of my diamonds was when informed by
Anton of the happenings of the night.”</p>

<p>Nick walked the floor of his room for a moment.</p>

<p>“What did Anton tell you?” he finally asked.</p>

<p>“He said that he heard a noise during the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and arose from his bed. As he stepped out in the
direction of the door opening into the hall, he was
struck a savage blow, from the effects of which he
did not recover until after daylight.”</p>

<p>“And your aunt?”</p>

<p>“She, too, says that she heard a noise and
stepped to the door of her chamber. It was dark
in the hallway, but her figure was outlined against
a window in the wall at her back. While standing
there, listening, she was struck on the forehead
and rendered unconscious until morning.”</p>

<p>“And you were asleep on that floor?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, directly across the hall from the
room occupied by my aunt. Uncle slept in a room
at the front of the house. Anton in a room at
the rear. The two rooms between these were occupied
by my aunt and myself, as I have already
stated.”</p>

<p>“The diamonds were in your trunk?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Was the trunk locked?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, it was not. You see, we have never
been molested before up there. I was not as cautious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
as I might have been. However, if the
trunk had been locked, it would have been all the
same, I imagine.”</p>

<p>“You might have been awakened by the forcing
of the lock,” said the detective. “It is strange
that you did not hear the sound of the blows
which killed your uncle and left your aunt unconscious.”</p>

<p>“I wonder at that,” said the young man, “for I
am not usually a heavy sleeper. But I hope you
can come out to the house at once. The sheriff
and two deputies are there, but no one save the
coroner has been admitted to the second floor.
Can you come now?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“And, another thing,” said the young man,
hesitation in his voice, “I wish you to act as my
personal representative in the search for the diamonds.
This may seem to you a selfish request,
with the murderer of my uncle still at large, but
it is a matter of great importance to me. The
diamonds constitute my sole inheritance from my
father. Nothing can bring my uncle back to life,
but the diamonds, recovered, will make my future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
life both useful and happy. Besides, the recovery
of the diamonds must point to the murderer.”</p>

<p>“That does not necessarily follow,” replied
Nick. “However, I will do the best I can for you.
You were at your uncle’s yesterday afternoon?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I have been stopping there for a month,
at his special request.”</p>

<p>“When and where were the diamonds delivered
to you?”</p>

<p>“At uncle’s, at three o’clock. They were
brought up from the city by a special messenger,
who took a receipt and returned on the first train
south.”</p>

<p>“When did you open the package containing
the diamonds?”</p>

<p>“Immediately.”</p>

<p>“Where did you open them?”</p>

<p>“In the parlor on the first floor.”</p>

<p>“Who was present?”</p>

<p>“Uncle, aunt, Anton, Bernice, aunt’s maid, and
myself.”</p>

<p>“Anton is your cousin by marriage only?”</p>

<p>“He is a son of my aunt by a first marriage.”</p>

<p>“I see. Where was he born?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“In Paris. He has lived there nearly all his
life.”</p>

<p>“Were there any servants about when the diamonds
were shown? Did the servants see the diamonds
at all?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Was the arrival of the gems talked of before
the servants?”</p>

<p>“To some extent, yes.”</p>

<p>“You were about the grounds in the afternoon?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I remember now that I sat on the
side porch a long time, looking over the lawn and
garden on that side of the house.”</p>

<p>“You observed no strangers about?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. Say! Two men came up from the
station and passed the house shortly after the departure
of the messenger who had delivered the
diamonds. They passed on about two hundred
yards, and then turned toward the depot. I did
not see them again.”</p>

<p>“What sort of appearing men were they?”</p>

<p>“I remember now that their dress and manner
gave me the impression that they were sailors.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“The sheriff has charge of the case, I presume?”</p>

<p>“Sheriff Walton is there in person. He was
notified quite early this morning at Anton’s request.”</p>

<p>“What direction is his investigation taking?”</p>

<p>“He has made a study of the grounds, and was
at the railroad station when I came away, questioning
the agent and the night watchman, who
had been sent for.”</p>

<p>“I am glad he has been kept out of the house,”
said the detective.</p>

<p>“I can’t get the thing through my head,” said
the young man. “One man murdered, two persons
assaulted and left unconscious, my own room
entered and robbed, and I the only one on the floor
not aroused by the noise. It seems a strange
case.”</p>

<p>“Now about the murder of your uncle,” said
Nick. “How was the death wound inflicted?”</p>

<p>“He was struck on the temple with some blunt
instrument. He was in his pajamas and lying
across the bed when found. It looks as if he had
arisen to a sitting position when awakened, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
was then seized by the throat. There are marks
as though a struggle had taken place.”</p>

<p>“And your aunt?”</p>

<p>“There is a cut over the left eye.”</p>

<p>“Not a serious one?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. It is difficult, however, to imagine
what sort of a weapon made the cut. It seems to
be three-cornered.”</p>

<p>“And Anton?”</p>

<p>“There is no question but that he was struck
with a pair of iron knuckles. The wound shows
that plainly enough.”</p>

<p>Nick remained silent for some moments. He
was puzzling over the fact that the gems had been
so soon located in the house by the thieves.</p>

<p>“By whom were the diamonds delivered?” he
finally asked.</p>

<p>“By a messenger from the American Express
office.”</p>

<p>“Who paid the duty?”</p>

<p>“The express company.”</p>

<p>“It must have been a heavy one.”</p>

<p>“It was,” answered the young man. “It took
all my little fortune.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Nick entered the telephone booth and called up
the American Express office. In a few moments
he learned that the diamonds had arrived in New
York the previous day at noon on an ocean liner,
and that they had remained in charge of the company
only an hour before the departure of the
messenger. No one in the employ of the company,
except the man who had paid the duty and
the manager, knew of the valuable contents of
the package.</p>

<p>While the detective was puzzling over the case,
Chick entered and was soon in possession of its
main features as known to his chief.</p>

<p>“Where were the diamonds shipped from?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Originally from Cape Town,” replied the
young man, “but direct from Liverpool.”</p>

<p>Chick looked at his chief with a smile on his
face.</p>

<p>“It is a pretty case, I imagine,” he said. “The
gems must have been followed from Cape Town.”</p>

<p>“Well, in that case,” said young Maynard, “the
man who did the following made quick work of it
after they arrived in this country. Of course, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
route to the hiding place of the murderer must be
discovered by tracing the diamonds. Don’t you
think so?” he added, turning to Nick.</p>

<p>“It will, I think, prove easier to find the murderer
than the diamonds,” said Nick. “The gems
may be passed on from hand to hand, or separated
and scattered to the end of the world, while the
murderer cannot halve his crime with any one.”</p>

<p>Nick ordered his automobile, and the three
were soon on their way to the country house on
the Hudson where the murder had been committed.</p>

<p>When they reached their destination they
found a crowd of curious suburbanites gathered
about the gate, which had been closed and locked
by the sheriff.</p>

<p>The house stood some distance from the road
in a grove of elm trees. A handsomely kept lawn
swept down to the iron fence which shut in the
grounds. It was a fine old mansion, with many
gables, porches, and odd corners. The dull red
walls were overrun with English ivy.</p>

<p>The detectives ascended at once to the upper
floor. The stairs brought them to a long hallway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
running just west of the tier of rooms at the
front of the house.</p>

<p>Entering the front room, they found the body
of the dead man lying on the bed. Nick at once
bent over it. His impression was that it had been
placed on the bed after the deathblow had been
struck, but the coroner had gone away for a time,
and he could ask no questions of him.</p>

<p>“It is worth looking up,” thought Nick.</p>

<p>As the detectives were beginning their work,
Sheriff Walton called out to them from the lower
hallway:</p>

<p>“I am going away for a time,” he said, “but
I’ll be back. Two suspicious men took a rig from
a local stable last night, and have not returned it.
I think that perhaps they are the men who were
here. You will find that the burglars gained entrance
by way of the west room, and passed on to
the front of the house. On the way they got the
diamonds from the trunk in Charley’s room.”</p>

<p>Nick smiled as the sheriff closed the door and
took his departure.</p>

<p>“He seems to have solved the case already,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
said Chick. “I presume he has the murderer in
sight now. Good luck to him, say I.”</p>

<p>“Here’s something to begin on,” continued
Chick, pointing to footprints in the hallway.
“See! There’s been a good deal of travel about
here, and in bare feet. I don’t quite understand
this, chief. I can’t see what it means. We have
been told that Mrs. Maynard and Anton lay unconscious
until morning, so I don’t see who did
all this walking about. I don’t believe people
came up here barefooted.”</p>

<p>The prints of naked feet led from door to door,
and in some places were quite numerous. They
passed from the north room to the south room,
back again, and from the east room to the north
room and back again. The south room was occupied
by the owner of the diamonds, the north
room by his aunt, and the east room by Alvin
Maynard, who lay dead there at the time of the
visit.</p>

<p>West of the doors of the side rooms, which
were exactly opposite each other, the hall was
narrower, and led only to a west room, occupied
by Anton Sawtelle. The marks here were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
those of naked feet. The person in the stockings
seemed to have made two trips to the front room.
The other marks might have been made after the
discovery of the crimes of the night.</p>

<p>One thing about the stocking marks struck the
detectives as peculiar. In each instance the outgoing
marks were close together, the incoming
marks far apart.</p>

<p>“This chap was in a mighty hurry, coming
back,” said Chick reflectively. “He made the return
trips in long jumps. Must have got scared
in the front room.”</p>

<p>“Anton might have visited his father’s room
before dressing,” said Nick, “and discovered the
dead body on the bed. That would naturally give
him a fright.”</p>

<p>“But he seems to have gotten two frights,” said
Chick, with a grin.</p>

<p>As Chick bent over the tracks Nick moved cautiously
toward the front of the hall. He was certain
that he heard footsteps there, that some one
was watching their movements—noting the
course their investigation was taking.</p>

<p>Finally he made a little rush to the front, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
was just in time to see a mass of dark hair disappearing
down the stairs. The wearer of the hair
looked back, and Nick saw a pair of handsome
black eyes.</p>

<p>“We were watched,” he mused, turning back
to the tracks. “The burglars, we are told, entered
by way of Anton’s room.”</p>

<p>The detectives passed down the hall and entered
the rear room, after it had been unlocked
from the inside. The young man who had unlocked
the door was already back in bed when
the detectives entered. His head was bandaged
and his face was pale as death. His eyes glared
unnaturally from under heavy brows. He was a
remarkably handsome man, although his face,
even with the pallor of suffering upon it, showed
signs of dissipation. His features were regular,
his hair black and waving, and his figure slender
and muscular.</p>

<p>“I called to you when you were at the door a
moment ago,” he said, “but you did not answer.
I presume you are Nick Carter? Yes. Well, I
am glad to see you. Hope you will find the murderer,
and also the brute who gave me this bump<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
on the head. My poor father! He was always
a father to me!”</p>

<p>“All in good time,” said Nick. “We are about
to make an examination of the premises, but
would like to ask you a few questions, provided
you are well enough to engage in conversation.”</p>

<p>“I am very much better,” was the reply, “and
perfectly able to tell you all I know about this
wretched affair.”</p>

<p>“What time did you go to bed last night?” was
the first question.</p>

<p>“About ten o’clock,” was the reply. “We keep
early hours up here in the country, you see,” he
added, with a wan smile.</p>

<p>“Did you retire for the night as soon as you
came upstairs? What I mean is, did you move
about your room or the hall?”</p>

<p>Sawtelle’s face became flushed, and he hesitated.
Although Nick’s eyes were seemingly not
fixed on his face, he noted every change of expression.
What Nick appeared to be looking at
was the gravel roof of a one-story lean-to attached
to the building at the west.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.
<br />
<small>CONFLICTING CLUES.</small></h2>


<p>Once the young man opened his lips to reply to
the question, but he changed his mind, evidently,
and remained silent for a time.</p>

<p>“Give me time to think,” he said, after a pause.
“I don’t seem to remember.”</p>

<p>“Did you come up here before your mother and
Mr. Maynard came up for the night?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I heard them come up and go to their
rooms.”</p>

<p>“Did they engage in conversation?”</p>

<p>“They did not,” was the hesitating reply. “To
tell the truth, they were not on good terms with
each other last night. That makes this affair all
the more terrible for mother.”</p>

<p>“Do you know the nature of their quarrel?”</p>

<p>“I do not.”</p>

<p>“Did you leave your room for any purpose
after they came up here?”</p>

<p>“I did not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“Until when?”</p>

<p>“This morning.”</p>

<p>“Then you went to Mr. Maynard’s room?”</p>

<p>“I went to mother’s room first. You see, I had
been attacked, and my first idea on regaining consciousness
was that some one else might have
been wounded.”</p>

<p>“That was quite early?”</p>

<p>“Just after daylight.”</p>

<p>“Where did you find your mother?”</p>

<p>“Lying on the floor. I placed her on the bed
and went on to Mr. Maynard’s room. I found
him dead, as you know.”</p>

<p>“Did you move the body?”</p>

<p>“I did not.” This with a shudder of horror.</p>

<p>“Were you dressed?”</p>

<p>“I was not. I had just tumbled off the bed,
where I had fallen, or been thrown by the robbers.
I think I had my trousers and socks on,
that is all. You must understand that about this
time I was hardly myself, and was laboring under
strong excitement. I hardly know what I did
after that. I remember of going to Charley’s
room, and of hearing him cry out that the diamonds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
had been stolen. You know I had lain in
an unconscious condition all night from this
wound on my head. I asked that Sheriff Walton
be sent for, and again became unconscious.”</p>

<p>“Did you succeed in arousing your mother
from her stupor?”</p>

<p>“I called to the servants to assist her.”</p>

<p>“How was she dressed?”</p>

<p>“In a nightrobe.”</p>

<p>“How about her feet?”</p>

<p>“They were bare.”</p>

<p>“Where was she taken, then?”</p>

<p>“Directly downstairs.”</p>

<p>“She was not able to walk about?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, she was carried down.”</p>

<p>Young Sawtelle closed his eyes as if from weariness,
and, quick as a flash, Nick lifted something
from under the edge of the bed and thrust it into
his pocket.</p>

<p>“Now, about the burglars,” said the detective.
“Do you know about what time it was when they
entered?”</p>

<p>“I have no idea.”</p>

<p>“What was the first sound you heard?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“I thought I heard a window rattle, and arose
to a sitting position.”</p>

<p>“And then?”</p>

<p>“I could see that there was some one in the
room, and I sprang out of bed to get a revolver
which I keep in the closet.”</p>

<p>“You did not reach the closet?”</p>

<p>“No. I met an iron knuckle and dropped to the
floor.”</p>

<p>“Did you visit the closet at all last night?”</p>

<p>“No; I am sure that I did not.”</p>

<p>“You caught no parting glimpse of the intruder’s
face?”</p>

<p>“No. There were two.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that?”</p>

<p>“I could see two forms outlined against the
window.”</p>

<p>“You heard them moving about the room?”</p>

<p>“Only for a moment.”</p>

<p>“Did they make much noise in moving about?”</p>

<p>“Very little.”</p>

<p>Nick now turned to the windows opening on the
roof of the lean-to to the west. The structure was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
covered with a gravel roof, and during the rain
of the night of the murder little pools of water
had formed. Into these sand had been swept.
Nick examined every one of these closely. In a
moment he called Chick to his side.</p>

<p>“Here is the autograph of one of the burglars,”
he said, pointing to an impression in one sandy
pocket of the roof.</p>

<p>“Rubber shoes,” said Chick.</p>

<p>“Exactly, with a tear in the sole of the right
shoe. It ought to be easy enough to follow this
fellow.”</p>

<p>Chick made a circuit of the little roof and came
back to his chief.</p>

<p>“The cut in the shoe which shows there,” he
said, “was made after the robber got to the roof.
The tin strap which supports the eave trough at
the west, where the ladder was raised, is broken,
and Mr. Burglar stepped on the sharp, upturned
edge.”</p>

<p>Nick descended the ladder, which remained as
the robbers had left it, and walked about the
grounds for a few moments, after which he returned
to the west room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“They came from the orchard,” he said, “and
after the rain.”</p>

<p>“The rain fell at two o’clock,” said Chick.</p>

<p>Nick turned to Sawtelle.</p>

<p>“It is your notion that you were knocked down
as soon as the thieves entered the room?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it remarkable that Charley was not
awakened?”</p>

<p>“He is a heavy sleeper.”</p>

<p>“What did he say in the morning?”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember.”</p>

<p>The young man was becoming nervous and impatient,
and Nick and his assistant left the room,
first asking permission to return later and search
for further traces of the burglars. In five minutes’
time, however, the young man passed them
in the hall and went downstairs.</p>

<p>The detectives looked at each other in silence
for a moment.</p>

<p>“He lies!” said Chick. “Mr. and Mrs. Maynard
did walk in the hall last night after they
were ready for bed, and he knows it, for he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
not asleep. I say he was not asleep because he
came out after them. Notice that the marks leading
from his door are over the ones made by
naked feet, and were therefore made last.”</p>

<p>“That looks all right on the face of it,” replied
Nick, “but he says he passed through the hall this
morning.”</p>

<p>“I overlooked that point,” said Chick, “but,
anyhow, he lied about the old people not moving
about.”</p>

<p>“He might have been asleep,” said Nick.
“Don’t jump at conclusions, my son.”</p>

<p>Chick bent over the floor.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“I am looking for the marks made by the burglars
in passing from the rear room to the front
one,” was the reply.</p>

<p>An inscrutable smile appeared on the face of
the detective.</p>

<p>“Look sharply,” he said. “Perhaps you may be
able to find what you are looking for.”</p>

<p>Chick arose and faced his chief with excitement
showing in his manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“They are not here,” he said. “What does it
mean?”</p>

<p>“There are the marks of stockinged feet,” suggested
Nick.</p>

<p>“But these two sets of tracks are the same,”
said the assistant, “and were, of course, made by
Anton. You have, I think, the socks he wore last
night in your pocket,” added Chick, with a smile.
“Suppose we compare them with the tracks?”</p>

<p>“You saw what I took from under the bed,
then?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. I had had my eyes on them for
some time.”</p>

<p>Nick took the socks from his pocket. They
fitted the tracks exactly.</p>

<p>“You see,” said Chick, “the burglars never left
that back room. Now, who murdered Alvin Maynard?
Who stole Charley Maynard’s diamonds?”</p>

<p>What Chick stated was the truth. There were
no indications that the burglars had left the
threshold of Anton’s room. And yet the old man
had been murdered at the other end of the hall
and the diamonds had been stolen from a room
which could be reached only by way of the hall!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Nick made no reply. Instead, he turned from
the hall and entered the room from which the
gems had been stolen. Everything was in order
there. The diamonds had been taken from a
trunk, and this stood near the head of the bed,
the cover swung back against the wall.</p>

<p>In the compartment at the right end of the till
was a casket, the one in which, under coarser covering,
the diamonds had been shipped to New
York. Nick took out his glass and inspected the
packing. Then he placed some of the cotton and
some of the paper in his pocketbook.</p>

<p>The trunk was of metal surface, and at the top
of the box the iron had been worn through to the
wood. Jagged edges of metal showed all along
the edge of the box. On one of these edges Nick
found a shred of pink wool, which he placed in
his pocket with the other articles.</p>

<p>Nick now entered the room which had been
occupied by Mrs. Maynard, going directly to the
dresser.</p>

<p>“What do you find?” asked Chick.</p>

<p>“Record of last night’s proceedings,” was the
reply. “It is as plain as if written in ink. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
heard it said,” continued the detective, “that no
person can enter a room without leaving some evidence
of the visit. This may be putting it too
strongly, but I am convinced that no person can
commit a crime without leaving behind a record
of the deed, as plain as printing, if we only know
how to read the language in which it is written.”</p>

<p>“That has often been proven,” said Chick.</p>

<p>The little right-hand drawer of the dresser
stood half open, disclosing a collection of rumpled
handkerchiefs of fine texture. The top of the
dresser was half covered with toilet articles.
There were powders and liquid preparations for
the face and hands, and many other articles designed
to keep the marks of advancing years from
showing too plainly. Nick picked up a jar of
yellowish paste and turned his glass on it. Then
he took the pieces of packing from his pocket.</p>

<p>“See here,” he said, “the woman went to
Charley’s room last night, after all was still in the
house, and took the diamonds and brought them
to this room.”</p>

<p>“Impossible!” cried Chick. “That silver-haired
old lady a thief—never.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“I did not say that she stole the gems,” said
Nick. “I said that she brought them to this room.
First, how do I know that she took them from the
trunk? Notice this jar of toilet paste. When she
got ready for bed she used that on her hands and
face—a common thing for women to do. Then,
after her light was out, and after Charley was in
bed and asleep, she entered his room and took the
diamonds from the casket.”</p>

<p>Chick listened, with wonder showing in his
eyes.</p>

<p>“I presume you know where all this points?” he
said.</p>

<p>“I know that she extinguished the light before
she left her room, because she groped her way
in the darkness and felt along the door for the
knob. She left traces of this toilet paste on the
panels. She did the same thing in Charley’s
room—groped her way in the darkness. More
traces of the toilet paste on the door and on the
trunk. This shows that Charley was not only in
bed, but asleep. Lastly, she left traces of the
paste on the packing from which she removed the
gems.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“Poor old woman!” said Chick.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment,” said Nick. “There is no
knowing what her motive was. She brought the
diamonds here and placed them in that little
drawer at the right of the dresser. See, some of
the packing clung to them, and it is still in the
drawer.”</p>

<p>“It seems to be a clear case,” said Chick.</p>

<p>“But the diamonds did not remain in the
drawer for any length of time,” said Nick. “Did
you know Alvin Maynard in his lifetime?”</p>

<p>The assistant shook his head.</p>

<p>“Then you do not know what an inveterate
snuff taker he was. Well, he came in here last
night, after the return of his wife, and removed
the gems from that drawer. His fingers were
soiled with snuff at the time, and he left traces
of it on the handkerchiefs in the drawer. The
handkerchiefs are also crumpled, showing that
the diamonds were not taken out in a calm manner.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Chick, more surprised than ever.</p>

<p>Nick now went to the old lady’s closet, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
opened from the sleeping room, and came out
with a pink nightrobe thrown over his shoulder.
He attempted no explanation until they both stood
in the front room, by the side of the bed whereon
the dead man lay.</p>

<p>“It is certain that the old lady followed her
husband to this room,” Nick said, then, “and that
a quarrel took place here. Observe how the gathers
are torn out at the neck of this nightrobe. It
all ended in her being pushed down or falling in a
faint. At any rate, the woman received her
wound in this room, and not in the doorway of
her own chamber, from the fist of a burglar, as
she is said to claim.”</p>

<p>Nick walked over to a couch which stood by a
front window. The head of the couch was composed
of a straight, sharp-cornered piece of quarter-sawed
oak, without upholstery of any kind
on the edge. On the outer corner of this headpiece
was a bruise and a stain of blood.</p>

<p>“It looks to me,” said Chick, “as if the burglary
was a put-up job, and that the diamonds are still
in the possession of some member of the Maynard
family. Why, for instance, should the old lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
lie about the way in which she received her
wound, if all is on the level here?”</p>

<p>Nick smiled and pointed to the couch.</p>

<p>“No woman,” he said, “would admit a quarrel
with her husband, much less a blow. It is therefore
easy to understand why she lays the wound
to the burglar. Besides, the diamonds she handled
last night have been stolen, and it would be
indiscreet for her to admit having them in her
possession, even for a minute, just before the robbery.
And, then, there is the murder. It is hard
to believe that any member of the family would
murder the old man.”</p>

<p>Nick turned to the bed again and regarded the
body carefully.</p>

<p>“The blow which killed Maynard,” he said,
“was not delivered while he lay or sat on the bed.
The body was placed there after the blow was
struck, and what blood came from the fatal
wound was wiped away. We ought to find traces
of that somewhere here.”</p>

<p>“There you are!” cried Chick. “No burglar
would stop to place a victim on the bed, or to wipe
away the blood! Now, how is your theory?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“The woman was revived here,” said Nick, “for
this nightrobe is still damp, so her son did not
find her unconscious in her room this morning, as
he claims.”</p>

<p>“I wonder how Anton got along with his stepfather?”
asked Chick.</p>

<p>“They never had any trouble that I know of,”
replied Nick.</p>

<p>“It is my notion,” said Chick, “that, as you say,
the woman was revived in this room, and also that
she witnessed the murder. Yet, according to all
accounts, she says nothing of it, which is unnatural,
unless it is true that the murderer is known
to her and entitled to her protection. And, another
thing, both Anton and his mother know
more about the doings of last night than they are
willing to admit, and they will remain under suspicion
in my mind until several points are cleared
up.”</p>

<p>Nick made no reply. There was a lot of sense
in what his assistant said, and yet he was not
ready to admit the truth of his deductions. He
returned to Anton’s room and entered the closet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
which the young man had stated he had not visited
the night before.</p>

<p>While Nick searched in the closet, Chick remained
by the outer door leading into the hall.
Presently he heard soft steps at the front of the
building. Whoever was moving about there was
doing so with attempt at secrecy. As the assistant
stood listening, the rustle of skirts was
added to the sound of the footsteps.</p>

<p>The steps seemed to enter the east room, where
the body lay, to return to the hall, pass into
Charley’s room, across into the old lady’s room.</p>

<p>Nick came to the door of the closet and pointed
toward the hall.</p>

<p>“Watch there,” he said. “You know a girl
came up here a little while ago and ducked away
as soon as discovered. This may be the same
one.”</p>

<p>Chick darted down the hall and entered the old
lady’s room. Standing in the middle of the floor
there he saw a rather pretty girl, with black hair
and eyes and regular features. She was tall and
slender, and seemed to be about twenty years of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
age. She curtsied and blushed as Chick entered
the room.</p>

<p>“What do you want here?” asked Chick.</p>

<p>“You are the famous Nick Carter?” asked the
girl, speaking in French, a language which Chick
understood perfectly.</p>

<p>“Why are you here?” continued Chick. “And
why were you here a short time ago?”</p>

<p>“I was not here a short time ago,” was the reply,
“and I come now at the command of my mistress.
Why should you say I was here a short
time ago, when I have been with my sick mistress
all morning?”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.
<br />
<small>COVERING CLUES.</small></h2>


<p>“And your mistress is Mrs. Maynard?” asked
Chick.</p>

<p>“Of a certainty.”</p>

<p>Chick saw that the girl was antagonistic, but
he did not show what his thoughts were. The
only way to secure information from the girl
would be to make friends with her. He asked:</p>

<p>“How is Mrs. Maynard this morning?”</p>

<p>“She is very ill, sir.”</p>

<p>“It is a terrible affair,” said Chick. “It is a
wonder that all the people in the house were not
murdered in their beds.”</p>

<p>“I shall be afraid to stay here now,” said the
girl, still speaking in French.</p>

<p>“You surely are not going away?” asked Chick.
“What will Mrs. Maynard do? She surely can’t
get a companion like you—young, devoted, and
attractive—every day.”</p>

<p>The girl blushed prettily. The flattery was winning
its way, seemingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“I must go about my work,” said the girl. “I
have to take to my mistress some of her clothes
from the closet.”</p>

<p>“Can I assist you?” asked Chick.</p>

<p>“Oh, no. It is only a few I carry.”</p>

<p>The girl went to the closet. Chick watched her
every move and glance. Entering the closet, she
looked anxiously about. She seemed disappointed
at not finding something she sought. Passing her
hands swiftly along the line of garments suspended
on hooks, the girl turned them out from
the wall and looked behind them.</p>

<p>“You are looking for something?” asked Chick.</p>

<p>“For a dress,” was the reply. “It is not here.
Ah!”</p>

<p>Standing in the doorway of the closet, the girl’s
eyes now fell on the pink nightrobe, lying on the
bed where Nick had tossed it.</p>

<p>The girl stepped briskly forth and seized the
robe, doubling it up and hiding as much of it from
view as was possible.</p>

<p>“And yet she claimed to be looking for a dress,”
thought Chick. “Here is mistake number one for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
us. We should have hidden that nightrobe. I
presume the woman will see that we do not get it
in our hands again. Rather bright girl this. I
wish Nick would happen in here just now.”</p>

<p>As if in answer to the thought, Nick appeared
in the doorway. Chick saw that his chief had
sized up the situation at a glance. The girl curtsied
to the new arrival and moved off with the
robe under her arm. Nick watched her from the
doorway as she passed along the hall toward the
front of the house.</p>

<p>When she came to the cross hall, directly in
front of the room which had been occupied by the
dead man, she dropped the robe to the floor. Instead
of picking it up at once, she, with a little
exclamation of impatience, gave it a push with
her foot, which sent it along the floor, not toward
the stairs, but to the south, down the hall which
ran straight from the head of the stairs to a wing
of the house, the upper floor of which was occupied
by the servants as sleeping rooms.</p>

<p>Nick stepped quickly forward, but the girl was
pushing the robe along with her foot, and the dust
on the linoleum was brushed aside, obliterating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
any marks which might have been there. The detective
smiled at the strategy displayed.</p>

<p>The hall down which the girl passed was not a
long one, and ended at a door which connected
with a hall in the wing. She was, therefore, soon
out of sight. As she closed the door Nick saw a
disdainful smile on her face.</p>

<p>“That’s a bright girl,” he said, as Chick stepped
to his side.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Maynard is covering clues,” said the assistant.
“Which shows that she has much to conceal.
The girl said she came after a dress, but
went away with the nightrobe which discloses the
story of the struggle. She was in Charley’s room
before she came here. I wonder what she took
from there?”</p>

<p>Nick stepped down the hall a few paces and
bent to the floor. When he came back he held a
shred of cotton in his fingers.</p>

<p>“She took the packing from the casket in which
the diamonds were brought here,” he said. “Mrs.
Maynard is getting well fast. The robe shows the
struggle, and the packing shows her touch. But
she came too late.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Chick drew the little drawer from the dresser
and held it out—empty.</p>

<p>“And the handkerchiefs show the presence of
the diamonds here, and also the grab made for
them by the old man. She must have taken them
before I got into the room, although I was only
a second behind her. What does it all mean,
chief? Is it possible that Mrs. Maynard knows
who killed her husband?”</p>

<p>Nick made no reply. He stood in the hallway
looking down at a footprint left in the dust by the
girl. He ended by taking a tape from his pocket
and measuring it. Then he went to the door at
the south end of the front hall and turned the
knob. The door was locked, but he had it open in
a moment.</p>

<p>No one was in sight as he glanced down the hall
in the wing. He stepped inside and tried the door
to the front room. It, too, was locked, but was
soon opened with his picklock. One glance at the
interior showed the detective that it was the room
occupied by the maid.</p>

<p>It was in perfect order, except that the robe,
just taken from the other part of the house, lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
across the back of a chair, and the handkerchiefs,
just taken from the dresser of her mistress, lay
on the bed. So Mrs. Maynard had not really regained
them, after all!</p>

<p>“Well,” thought the detective, “she may have
ordered the girl to get them out of sight. It is
a wonder to me that she did not think of that
sooner. We should have been all at sea had she
ordered that floor swept early this morning.”</p>

<p>Nick went to where his assistant stood and announced
that he had about concluded his work
there.</p>

<p>“What did you find in the closet?” Chick asked.</p>

<p>Nick did not reply immediately. He seemed
to be in one of his brooding moods. He walked
back to the rear room again and stood at the
closet door with his measuring tape in his hands.
Again he went to the room where the dead man
lay and studied the position of the body and the
character of the wound which had resulted in instant
death. Once more he went over the hall
leading to the door of the west room, this time
using a glass on every inch of it. Chick, standing
at the door of Charley’s room, heard him mutter:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“It isn’t possible. I surely must be mistaken.
And yet here it is; in black and red, literally. It
is too brutal to be true! Too brutal! Too unnatural!”</p>

<p>Chick pondered over the words for a long time.
Nick was not much given to talking his thoughts
aloud, and Chick knew that he must be greatly
moved to do so now.</p>

<p>But Chick knew that his chief had made some
discovery which he did not care to communicate,
because of his uncertainty as to its bearing on the
case.</p>

<p>“It’s an odd case,” said Nick presently. “We
can only trace the stolen gems to members of the
family, and there is the murder.”</p>

<p>“But in terror of discovery,” said Chick, “is it
not possible that even a member of the family
might have dealt the blow which killed the old
man?”</p>

<p>Nick made no reply. He walked down the hall
leading to the servants’ quarters, and examined
the floor both at the door and near it. The
cunning maid had swept the floor clean along the
path of travel with the robe, but Nick continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
his investigations along the walls, where the robe
had not touched.</p>

<p>At last he turned away and, accompanied by
his assistant, passed down the stairs and entered
the parlor on the floor below. There they found
Charley awaiting their arrival. Nick closed the
door which communicated with other parts of the
house, and asked:</p>

<p>“How long has the maid been here?”</p>

<p>Charley smiled.</p>

<p>“Don’t waste your time there,” he said. “She
came from Paris with aunt ten or more years ago,
and is devoted to the family.”</p>

<p>“When was your aunt married to Mr. Maynard?”
was the next question.</p>

<p>“About ten years ago. They met first in
Paris.”</p>

<p>“Then the maid was with your aunt before the
marriage?”</p>

<p>“I think so. She is more of a companion than
a maid, though.”</p>

<p>“How long has Anton lived here?”</p>

<p>“About a year.”</p>

<p>“And before that time?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“He lived in Paris.”</p>

<p>“Supported by your aunt?”</p>

<p>“I think so.”</p>

<p>“Has she an income of her own?”</p>

<p>“A very small one. She lost most of it when
she remarried.”</p>

<p>“I see. Is Anton to remain here? What I
mean is, was it his purpose on coming here to remain
in this country?”</p>

<p>Charley laughed uneasily.</p>

<p>“There was nothing else for him to do,” he
said. “He could no longer live on the money he
was receiving, and so he had to go to work or
come here.”</p>

<p>“Ah! And he did not like the idea?”</p>

<p>“He did not.”</p>

<p>“And the maid? She also longs for Paris?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are off the track,” said Charley.
“They do not get on well when together, and the
girl would not leave aunt. There is nothing in
that line.”</p>

<p>“You think they have a mutual dislike for each
other?” asked Nick, with a smile.</p>

<p>“I am certain of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“How long since this began to show?”</p>

<p>“Well, they were shy of each other from the
first. Lately they have quarreled in the presence
of the servants.”</p>

<p>“Only lately?”</p>

<p>“Only lately,” repeated Charley.</p>

<p>“They knew each other in Paris?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so, when they were children.”</p>

<p>“Now, how has Anton been supplied with
money since he came here?”</p>

<p>“By my aunt.”</p>

<p>“Has he ever complained of the size of the allowance?”</p>

<p>“Not that I am aware of, but he has borrowed
of me.”</p>

<p>“And repaid?”</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, and then Nick
asked:</p>

<p>“Was it generally known in the house that the
diamonds were coming?”</p>

<p>“Yes. The matter was often talked of.”</p>

<p>Again there was a long pause.</p>

<p>“Oh, say,” said Charley presently, “you may as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
well give up that line of inquiry. We know well
enough how the thieves got into the house, and
how they got the gems. You see, they left plenty
of clues behind. The sheriff thinks he has them
located already. What have you discovered?”</p>

<p>The detective had no idea of reporting progress
at that time, so he ignored the question and asked
for Mrs. Maynard.</p>

<p>“She is too ill to be seen,” said Charley.</p>

<p>“And the maid is with her? By the way, what
is the name of the maid?”</p>

<p>“Her name is Bernice. Yes, she is with my
aunt.”</p>

<p>“Is Mrs. Maynard still unconscious?” asked
Chick.</p>

<p>“Only partially so,” was the reply. “She is in
a low condition, physically, and the shock of last
night has affected her seriously.”</p>

<p>“You have called a physician?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>As the question was answered the physician
made his appearance in the parlor. He was old
and gray, and had long been in attendance on the
family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“How are your patients?” asked Charley.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sawtelle is so far improved as to be able
to take the air in the orchard,” was the reply, “but
Mrs. Maynard is not satisfactorily recovering
from the shock.”</p>

<p>“Is she suffering pain?” asked Charley.</p>

<p>“I think not. The trouble seems to be a mental
one. I fear for her reason if there is not a change
almost immediately.”</p>

<p>“Bernice is with her?” asked Charley.</p>

<p>“She was until a moment ago,” was the reply.
“Then she called one of the servants and left the
house.”</p>

<p>Nick and Chick exchanged glances, and the
latter almost immediately left the parlor, taking
the direction of the orchard as soon as he was out
of the house.</p>

<p>Passing along the south side of the house,
Chick came to a barrier of evergreens which shut
out a view of the orchard from the front. Away
to the left, however, there was a gate, and the detective
turned toward it. As he moved along he
heard voices on the other side of the hedge. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
could not distinguish the words, but the voices
were those of Anton and Bernice!</p>

<p>Chick passed through the gate and walked
around the rear of the house to the place where
the ladder had been lifted to the roof of the lean-to,
hoping to see the couple on the way. However,
the voices ceased, and the young people were
nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>The doctor quitted the parlor shortly after
Chick’s departure, and, thus left alone with
Charley, Nick asked:</p>

<p>“You said this morning that you are a light
sleeper. How did you rest last night? Were you
in your usual health when you awoke?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the reply. “I had a frightful headache,
and my stomach was in bad shape. It is seldom
that I awake in bad condition. Perhaps I
slept too soundly.”</p>

<p>“Did you partake of food or drink after supper
last night?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>Charley looked the surprise he did not express.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, in a moment, “it was a hot
night, and we had ice cream and lemonade in the
parlor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who suggested it?”</p>

<p>“I think I did.”</p>

<p>“Who prepared it?”</p>

<p>“Some one in the kitchen.”</p>

<p>“Who served it?”</p>

<p>“Bernice.”</p>

<p>“How long did you remain awake after partaking
of the cream and lemonade?”</p>

<p>“Not very long. I was tired, and soon became
sleepy and went off to bed.”</p>

<p>Nick walked the floor for a moment.</p>

<p>“I know what your questions mean,” said
Charley excitedly. “You think I was drugged last
night!”</p>

<p>Nick made no reply.</p>

<p>“I had thought of that,” continued Charley,
“because of my unusual sleep, but had rejected the
notion because every member of the family partook
of the refreshments which were served, and
because the suspicion seemed to point to some
member of the family as the burglar and the murderer.”</p>

<p>“Never mind that now,” said Nick. “Did you
see much of Anton last night?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, he was with me until I retired.”</p>

<p>“And Bernice?”</p>

<p>“She was with my aunt in the sitting room the
greater part of the evening.”</p>

<p>“You do not know whether she retired early?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. She usually does go to bed as
soon as my aunt releases her from duty for the
night, and aunt went to her room early last evening,
before I did, in fact. Anton was the only
one in the parlor when I left.”</p>

<p>“Where was Bernice?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“She was somewhere about the house. I remember
now that aunt did not require her services
in her chamber.”</p>

<p>“She might have been in bed?”</p>

<p>“No, she was not, for I heard her voice downstairs,
just before I left for my room. She was
somewhere at the back of the house.”</p>

<p>“What time did Mr. Maynard go to his room?”
asked Nick.</p>

<p>“He was there most of the evening. He had
what the boys call a grouch about something, I
guess.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where were the diamonds during the evening?”</p>

<p>“In my trunk.”</p>

<p>Nick pondered a moment, and turned away, going
to the door, from which he turned back to ask:</p>

<p>“Were the diamonds in your trunk when you
went to bed?”</p>

<p>Charley laughed.</p>

<p>“No doubt of that,” he said. “I looked at
them.”</p>

<p>Nick walked to and fro on the lawn until Chick
came up.</p>

<p>“You found Bernice in consultation with Anton,
I presume,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, they were in the orchard together.”</p>

<p>“You could not hear their talk?”</p>

<p>Chick shook his head.</p>

<p>The county physician who served as coroner
was now summoned and the body placed at his
disposal.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to have delayed you in your work
so long,” Nick said, “but I did not want to miss
any possible clues by having it removed before a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
thorough examination of the room had been
made.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” said the coroner. “I’ll
get a few of the neighbors together and hold an
inquest right away. It will be death at the hands
of some person unknown, I suppose. Rather a
bold deed, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Nick soberly, “rather a bold deed.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.
<br />
<small>A GROUP OF THREE.</small></h2>


<p>“Shall you attend the inquest?” asked Chick, as
the two detectives moved away in the direction
of the orchard.</p>

<p>“No,” was the reply. “As the coroner said, the
verdict will be that Maynard came to his death
at the hands of some person or persons unknown.
I want the formalities through with as soon as
possible.”</p>

<p>The detectives now found themselves at the
foot of the ladder which had been raised to the
lean-to roof by the burglars. The footprints were
still plainly visible.</p>

<p>As has been stated, rain had fallen on the previous
night, and the surface of the earth was still
damp. The marks of rubber soles were still to
be seen in the soft mold between the trees. They
led to the north side of the orchard, then across a
pasture lot, and onto the highway running parallel
with the railroad track. They were lost only
when the men approached the station platform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“This looks like a put-up trail,” said Chick.</p>

<p>“It looks like the work of amateur burglars,”
said Nick, “who depend upon losing themselves
in the city, and thus escaping the officers.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if they carried the diamonds over
that route?” asked Chick.</p>

<p>“And I was wondering,” said Nick, “if they
knew what to do with the gems when they got to
the city.”</p>

<p>“How could they have the diamonds?” asked
Chick. “They did not get beyond Anton’s room,
and the diamonds were not there. I guess the
members of the Maynard family were too quick
for them.”</p>

<p>“Don’t jump at conclusions,” warned Nick.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t like the looks of things up there,”
said the assistant, “and I have an idea that they
ought to be watched.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said the chief. “You are to go
back there and hang around with Charley Maynard
as soon as we land these fellows on the train,
or become convinced that they did not take a train
back to the city.”</p>

<p>“There is a train leaves here at four o’clock in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the morning,” said Chick, referring to a timetable.
“They might have taken that.”</p>

<p>The fact was that Chick found himself not a
little puzzled at the attitude of his chief in the
case. Had he been permitted to have his own
way, all the investigations would have been confined
to the Maynard house.</p>

<p>He regarded the burglary as merely incidental,
and would not have wasted a moment on it. As
he explained to Nick, he did not see how the burglars
could have committed the murder or stolen
the gems, as they had penetrated into the house
no farther than the rear room.</p>

<p>He determined that if he was left at the house,
in charge of the case there, the inmates would
have some pretty hard questions to answer.</p>

<p>Nick must have detected his intentions, for
he said:</p>

<p>“Let the inmates of the house alone; let them
say and do what they please, and go where they
see fit; but keep your eyes on them. I want to
know whom they see and what they do.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Chick, not a little disappointed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now,” continued the chief, “it may be that
Charley was drugged on the night of the murder
and robbery. See what you can learn about that.”</p>

<p>“You think that probable?”</p>

<p>“It is at least possible,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Then that shows a desire on the part of some
one in the house to rob him. As I said before, I
think the burglars were on a worked-out claim.”</p>

<p>Nick chuckled, but said nothing.</p>

<p>Chick had differed with his chief in so many
cases which had been won that he was not inclined
to force his opinions to the front, so he
remained silent.</p>

<p>The railroad station at which the detectives
now stood was a small affair, and was usually
closed in the nighttime. No through trains
stopped there, but at four o’clock in the morning
a local passed into the city, and an agent was always
there at that time.</p>

<p>A short distance from the station was a little
suburban store where fruit and light lunches were
sold. Many suburbanites took and left the trains
there during the day, and the keeper of the store
did quite a business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Nick approached him as he stood serving coffee
and sandwiches to two travelers.</p>

<p>“Were you here this morning?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I sleep here,” was the reply.</p>

<p>Nick called him aside as soon as his customers
left.</p>

<p>“Were you in your place of business when the
train passed here at four o’clock this morning?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“The place was not open,” was the reply, “but
I was awake.”</p>

<p>“Did the train stop?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. It always does. There are usually
early birds out. We call them four-o’clockers.”</p>

<p>“Their work in the city begins early?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“Do you happen to know whether any strangers
were about here when the train came in?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I do,” was the reply. “I usually don’t,
but this morning a fool couple got under my window
there at the back of the house and whispered,
and talked, and quarreled, until I was ready to get
up and fight.”</p>

<p>“You could not hear what they were saying?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“I caught a word only now and then. I was
too mad to listen quietly.”</p>

<p>“That was a queer place for a conference—under
a sleeping-room window,” suggested the detective.</p>

<p>“Oh, they probably thought the house unoccupied
during the night. It doesn’t look much like
a residence, now, does it?”</p>

<p>The man cocked his head to one side and regarded
the little structure, built of plain boards
nailed on perpendicularly and battened, with a
critical eye.</p>

<p>“But the people who usually come to this station
know your habits, don’t they?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“I should think they ought to,” was the reply.
“I have been here long enough.”</p>

<p>“Then these men must have been strangers?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I have no doubt of that.”</p>

<p>“You say they quarreled?”</p>

<p>“Not until a third man came up.”</p>

<p>“So there was a third man?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I say three at first?”</p>

<p>“No, you said two.”</p>

<p>“Well, there were two at first, and then a third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
man came, and they got into a mix-up over something.”</p>

<p>“Did they fight?”</p>

<p>“Only with their mouths.”</p>

<p>“About what?”</p>

<p>“About putting something in a trunk.”</p>

<p>Nick saw that the country merchant did not
know how to relate what had taken place with
reference to the leading points, so he was obliged
to humor him and ask many questions.</p>

<p>“So they had a trunk?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I say they had a trunk?”</p>

<p>“You did not. Was the trunk delivered there
in a wagon?”</p>

<p>“No. A man, the third man, brought it on his
shoulder.”</p>

<p>“Did they open it?”</p>

<p>“Of course. Didn’t I say they quarreled about
putting something in it?”</p>

<p>“Did they put something in it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, after a lot of talking.”</p>

<p>“What did they say?”</p>

<p>“Two men said it was safer to carry the package,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and the third man said they knew what his
orders were.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear any names mentioned?”</p>

<p>“Just one.”</p>

<p>“What was that name?”</p>

<p>“Hartley.”</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>It was with difficulty that Nick concealed his
joy. Hartley was the name of a noted diamond
dealer in New York, and Hartley was said by the
police to furnish money for enterprises of a shady
nature!</p>

<p>“What was said concerning Hartley?” asked
Nick, in a moment.</p>

<p>“I only heard his name mentioned once.”</p>

<p>“You heard nothing said regarding the contents
of the package they put in the trunk?” asked
the detective.</p>

<p>“I heard one of the men say that they would be
fools to give up so much without getting their
money down.”</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>So Hartley had already arranged for the diamonds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
to be delivered to him. The third man was
Hartley’s agent.</p>

<p>“Where did this third man come from?” asked
Nick.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. He must have come in from
some of the burgs where the morning train does
not stop, and carried his trunk with him.”</p>

<p>“Was it a large trunk?”</p>

<p>“No. A small one.”</p>

<p>“What did they finally do with it?”</p>

<p>“They gave it in charge of the baggageman
when the train came, after getting it checked by
the station agent.”</p>

<p>“Who did?”</p>

<p>“The man who brought it.”</p>

<p>“With the package inside?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“You saw them hand it over?”</p>

<p>“Yes. The men parted after the train came in,
and I did not see the two Englishmen again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they were Englishmen?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Didn’t I say so?”</p>

<p>“The man must have bought a ticket to get the
trunk checked?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“Did the men part in anger?”</p>

<p>“Why, when they all ran off, they did not have
time to say good-by to each other. They were too
much in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“You did not say that they got away in a
hurry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, didn’t I? Well, they did. They found
out that some one was listening. That was just
after the train came in. So they ducked, and the
man who had been listening went to the train.”</p>

<p>“How long was he there?”</p>

<p>“Just a minute. When he came up to where
the trunk had been opened, after they left, the
girl made her appearance, and they walked away
together in the direction of the platform. I did
not recognize either of them. You see it was
dark, and they were not close to the window.”</p>

<p>“Now you’ve brought a girl in,” said Nick.
“You must have had quite a matinée under your
window this morning.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you about the girl before?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not.”</p>

<p>“Well, it struck me that she was down here to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
meet some one who came on the train, and went
away on the train.”</p>

<p>Nick began to look puzzled. This was not so
easy. Who was this girl? Could it have been
Bernice? Could it have been any one from the
Maynard house? Had the girl and the strange
man been sent there to watch the others and see
that the trunk was on the train according to arrangements
previously made by Hartley?</p>

<p>Nick had a notion who the Englishmen were.</p>

<p>They were probably the sailors Charley had
seen the previous afternoon.</p>

<p>Chick had suggested that the diamonds had
been followed from Cape Town or from Liverpool,
and this might prove to be a fact.</p>

<p>The part of the third man was plain enough,
Nick thought. He was there to receive the diamonds
from the thieves. Hartley would take no
chances of their being delivered to him in the city.</p>

<p>But this fourth man and the girl? That was
the puzzler.</p>

<p>“How many girls live close about here?” asked
Nick.</p>

<p>“Girls? Dozens of ’em. What with the daughters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of the suburbanites, and their maids and servants,
I can’t begin to keep track of them.”</p>

<p>“But none live close to the station.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they are often about here at the time this
early train passes. I don’t know where they all
come from, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Nick, “if a man came here on a
train and left on the same one, and met a girl here,
it must have been by previous arrangement, of
course, and may occur again. You keep your eye
out for a couple of weeks when this morning train
passes, and you shall be well paid for your work.”</p>

<p>“All right,” was the reply, as the man pocketed
a banknote of liberal denomination. “They won’t
get away from me again.”</p>

<p>Nick now went to the station agent and asked
about the tickets purchased for the early morning
train. The agent declared that none had been
bought that morning.</p>

<p>“But a trunk was checked,” insisted the detective.</p>

<p>“That was on a ticket bought in the afternoon,”
said the agent.</p>

<p>“Do you know how many people took that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
morning train from this station?” asked the detective.</p>

<p>“I do not.”</p>

<p>“Did you see people waiting for the train
here?”</p>

<p>“Say,” said the agent, “I don’t know what’s
getting into folks to-day. It seems that there
was something doing when that train went by.”</p>

<p>“Ah! the sheriff has been here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and a lot from the Maynard house.”</p>

<p>“Who, for one?”</p>

<p>“Anton Sawtelle for one. Got quite a clip,
didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Sure he did,” was the reply. “What questions
did he ask?”</p>

<p>“Just about what you did. He wanted to know
who left here on the morning train.”</p>

<p>“And you could not tell him?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. The conductor may be able to,
though.”</p>

<p>“Did Sawtelle give descriptions of people and
ask you to verify them?”</p>

<p>“He asked for two men carrying the odor of
rum, and for a black-haired girl.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>So here was the girl again!</p>

<p>And Sawtelle knew of her presence at the station!</p>

<p>“What else did he say about the girl, or about
the men?”</p>

<p>“He said the men talked with a strong London
accent; nothing more about the girl.”</p>

<p>Anton must have hastened to the station while
the detectives were at the house!</p>

<p>There was now no such thing as leaving him
out of the case!</p>

<p>“Who left the train here?” asked Nick, in a
moment.</p>

<p>“I am certain that no one left the train here.”</p>

<p>“Anton asked about a girl. Did you notice a
girl loitering about here previous to the arrival of
the train, or after it left this morning?”</p>

<p>“I did not. No girl came in here.”</p>

<p>“So the girl, if there was one, kept in the background?”</p>

<p>“Yes; that’s it.”</p>

<p>Nick left the agent and walked up and down
the small platform.</p>

<p>“The gems may be at Hartley’s by this time,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
he thought. “The two Englishmen who smell of
rum and talk like London may be on the ocean
by this time, but I imagine I know where the girl
is. This case is not so mixed, after all.”</p>

<p>After a long talk with Chick, the detective took
a train for New York, hopeful and enthusiastic
over the clues he had already uncoiled.</p>

<p>Chick returned to the Maynard home.</p>

<p>It was dull there, and for a long time there
were no movements among the inmates that
seemed worthy of attention.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.
<br />
<small>CUNNING FOES.</small></h2>


<p>That evening, while Chick sat in comfort on the
north porch at the Maynard house, strong in the
belief that his chief had gone to New York in
quest of a murderer and thief who was then in
that house, Nick was standing in front of a small,
mean-looking store near Chatham Square.</p>

<p>There was a pawnbroker’s sign over the door,
and diamonds were shown in the windows in
goodly quantities. On the door itself, the top
half of which was of glass, was the line: “Diamonds
bought and sold.” Below was the one
word: “Hartley.”</p>

<p>The detective had reached the city at three
o’clock, and at once “made up” for an inspection of
the diamond merchant’s place of business. Standing
across the street, Nick had the appearance of
a sailor having a leave of absence and a desire to
observe all that was worth seeing in the city.</p>

<p>Presently Nick went into the store and stood by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the front counter, which was covered with show
cases, each containing diamonds of all sizes and
shades. The salesman who came forward to wait
upon him leaned on one of the cases carelessly,
and looked only casually at the pretended sailor.</p>

<p>“I wants to sell me di’mond,” said Nick.</p>

<p>“Let’s see it, mate.”</p>

<p>Nick took from his pocket a superb stone worth
fully $500. It was finely cut and had been removed
from its setting. In fact, it was a stone
which the detective frequently wore.</p>

<p>“’Ow much for it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Where did you get it?” asked the clerk.</p>

<p>Nick gave an impatient hitch to his breeches.</p>

<p>“This hain’t no bloomin’ police station, is it?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“No,” was the reply, “but we like to know
where the goods we buy come from.”</p>

<p>Nick put the stone back into his pocket and
moved toward the door.</p>

<p>“Wait,” said the clerk. “How much do you
want for it?”</p>

<p>“Four ’undred,” was the short reply.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you fifty dollars,” said the clerk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Nick went back and began to haggle with the
clerk. What he wanted was to keep in the store
long enough to size it up thoroughly. Besides, he
had a notion that the two men who had been described
as smelling of rum, and talking like London,
might pay their respects to the diamond merchant.</p>

<p>Now and then during the conversation Nick
walked to the front door and looked out into the
street. Just across the way, Patsy, next to Chick,
his best assistant, stood in a make-up similar to
that worn by his chief.</p>

<p>Nick had an idea that the two sailors, who were
evidently unused to the ways of New York crooks,
would loiter about Hartley’s place.</p>

<p>Patsy was watching in the street for the reason
that the men might visit the vicinity of the diamond
shop without actually going in. If they
came within sight, he was to motion to Nick if it
were possible to make him see, through the
crowd; and if not, he was to go to the store after
him.</p>

<p>But it was not necessary for Patsy to signal to
Nick or to call him from the store. As the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
approached the door, after being in the establishment
for some time, he saw two men resembling
the ones he sought standing in front of the store.
They were talking together earnestly, making
quick gestures with their hands.</p>

<p>Nick passed out into the street and halted near
them. One of the men looked the detective over
and approached him, pushing pedestrians aside
like a man in the fighting stage of intoxication.</p>

<p>“’Ello, shipmate,” he said, laying a hand heavily
on Nick’s shoulder. “Doin’ biz with that
bloomin’ shark?”</p>

<p>“’E won’t buy,” replied Nick. “’E wants the
bloomin’ earth, ’e does.”</p>

<p>“’E’s a shark, a’ Hindian Hocean shark,”
roared the sailor. “’E’s got to take a broadside
from me the day.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t out on no bloomin’ desert island
now,” said Nick. “You’ll get in irons, that’s what
you’ll get, if you lay alongside of that pirate here.
Offered me fifty dollars for a five-hundred-dollar
diamond, that’s wot ’e did, blast ’im.”</p>

<p>Patsy came up at this moment, and the four
wandered away to a drinking place on the Bowery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and sat down at a table. Nick was by no
means certain that the men he was with were the
ones he sought.</p>

<p>They drank rum liberally at Nick’s expense, but
did not appear to get much the worse for their
libations. They cursed Hartley from keel to topmast,
as one of them expressed it, but refused to
mention the cause of their hatred.</p>

<p>“You’re from Lonnon,” Nick said, after a time.
“’Ow is the old town?”</p>

<p>Nick knew London like a book, and his reference
to the music halls and sailor resorts set the
men to talking.</p>

<p>“We’re goin’ back when we gets brass enough,”
one of them said. “We’ve come over ’ere on a
bloomin’ cruise after the wind on the tops of the
tall buildings, that’s wot we has, mate.”</p>

<p>One of the men sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“Hi’m goin’ after ’im,” he said.</p>

<p>“You’re drunk,” said the other. “Let ’im
alone.”</p>

<p>“Hif you’re afraid to go, Hi goes halone,” was
the reply.</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you to see the shark,” said Nick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>The sailor seized Nick’s hand and almost
dragged him to the door.</p>

<p>“We’ll board the bloomin’ pirate,” he said.</p>

<p>The detective began to think that he had made
no mistake in figuring on the movements of the
two strange men.</p>

<p>“This man is drunk,” he thought, “but not so
drunk as he pretends to be. He has probably
nerved himself with liquor for an unpleasant interview.
If he is the man I suspect him to be,
the fact is likely to come out in the talk between
the merchant and himself. If he is not one of the
sailors who appeared at the Maynard house yesterday,
I shall soon know that.”</p>

<p>The detective was now in a section of New
York where the life of a man known to be in
quest of lawbreakers is hardly safe. The lawless
ones of the great city often make that section
their home when pursued by officers of the law,
and will defend each other to the death.</p>

<p>The establishment of the diamond merchant
was ostensibly respectable, but there were in police
records accounts of men and women who had
entered the half-glazed door possessed of valuable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
gems and had never returned to their former
haunts. Nick knew that the outlaws of New
York boasted that there were hidden cellars and
secret rooms and stairways in the buildings of
that quarter which no officer had ever been able
to discover.</p>

<p>The sailor entered the store and advanced toward
the rear, which was dimly lighted by a yellow
jet of gas, the daylight which came through
the dusty glass in front not penetrating into the
back of the long room. There, on a high stool at
a standing desk, bent over the pages of a great
book of accounts, was a man with iron-gray hair
and stooping shoulders. He glanced up as the
two men approached, and Nick made a mental
note of the keenest black eyes he had ever seen
under a mass of gray hair.</p>

<p>The sailor stepped up to the desk and laid his
arm insolently on a pile of books at the merchant’s
elbow. Then he steadied himself and
glared at the figure before him.</p>

<p>“You are here again, are you?” asked the merchant
impatiently. “I told you to keep away from
here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“You know wot I come for,” said the sailor
sullenly.</p>

<p>“Who is that with you?” demanded the diamond
merchant suspiciously.</p>

<p>“A mate I picked hup out ’ere.”</p>

<p>“If your mate has influence with you,” said the
merchant, “I advise him to use it in getting you
aboard ship as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“Hartley is playing a bold game,” thought
Nick.</p>

<p>“’And hout hour coin, then,” said the sailor,
“an’ we’ll go soon enough.”</p>

<p>“We have had enough of this,” said Hartley.
“You must cease to persecute me or take the consequences.
However, this is no matter to discuss
before a third party. Come with me, and you,
matey, remain where you are.”</p>

<p>Hartley moved toward a rear door, accompanied
by the sailor, and Nick stepped back to a chair
which stood at the end of the counter, hidden
from the front by a stack of boxes and books.
The clerk in front walked back and saw that the
detective was in the chair, and returned to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
front, seemingly to watch through the door for
customers.</p>

<p>The thing for Nick to do now was to listen to
the conversation which was to take place between
the men who had just left him. But how? There
were two doors opening from the room to the
rear. One was at about the middle of the store,
and the other was close to the wall at the left,
and about opposite the chair in which Nick sat.</p>

<p>Hartley and the sailor had passed through the
centre door, so this probably led to another room.
The other door, being near the wall, undoubtedly
led to a hallway running to the rear of the building.
Nick resolved to investigate. Seeing that
his weapons were handy, he moved toward the
side door, being careful to keep below the top of
the long desk.</p>

<p>The clerk was apparently busy in front, and did
not hear the door open, as Nick supposed, and
so the detective stepped into a dark passage and
prepared to bring his flash into use. Then, before
he could take the lantern from his pocket, he
heard a sharp click, like the movement of a metallic
spring, and dropped into the darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>The floor had fallen away beneath his feet, and
he was sliding down a well of a place which
seemed scores of feet deep and just large enough
in diameter to permit the passage of his body. It
was the old trick of lower New York, which had
been worked thousands of times, and will be
worked as many times more.</p>

<p>Nick, who had been up against the trapdoor
game before, would naturally have been more
careful in that treacherous establishment only for
the fact that he believed his disguise perfect, and
Hartley rather above the murder of inquisitive
men whom he had had no occasion to suspect of
greater interference with his plans than the opening
of a door for the purpose of listening to a
forbidden conversation.</p>

<p>As Nick dropped into the dark tunnel, he heard
a trapdoor close above his head, and at the same
instant his right heel caught in what seemed to be
little more than a horizontal crevice in the wall of
the place. At the moment of falling he had
crowded his feet out to the sides and his hands
to the front, in hope of finding some break to
check his fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Finding that his heel was slipping from the
place where it rested, Nick drew out his knife,
which opened as he removed it from his pocket,
the blade being controlled by a spring at the back,
and drove it into the wall to his left. Supported
by this and by the foothold on the right, the detective
began an investigation of the place.</p>

<p>He could have used his lantern readily enough,
as the right hand was free, but he was afraid of
watching eyes, so he groped about in the darkness,
hoping to find an outlet about where his heel
had struck.</p>

<p>He understood the trap games of New York
well enough to know that the shaft communicated
with more than one basement of the building,
which was an old one and probably full of devices
for the destruction of unwelcome guests.
If he could come upon a door connecting with the
floor directly underneath the store, the trick of
the diamond merchant might, after all, be turned
to good advantage.</p>

<p>A careful examination of the wall on the right
convinced the detective that the door to the first
basement was where his foot had struck; that, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
fact, his heel rested on a bit of flooring under the
crack of the door.</p>

<p>“Now,” he thought, “I wonder which way this
door opens? If they throw people down here, it
opens into the room; if they back people up
against the wall and let them fall in, it opens into
the shaft! Ah! Here it is.”</p>

<p>The door gave way under the pressure of
Nick’s foot, and a faint light crept into the shaft.
There was a light at the front of the first basement,
and men were there engaged in unpacking
boxes.</p>

<p>It was no easy matter for Nick to change his
position so as to pass through the doorway, but he
succeeded at last, and stood in the shadows cast
by the flaring gas jet in front. He knew that
those at work could not see him, so he moved
about with considerable confidence.</p>

<p>The basement was used for storing, and packing
and unpacking, goods of many kinds. At the
back, where Nick stood, it was well-nigh filled
with boxes of various sizes. At the right of the
basement, facing from the front, was a stairway
running to the store floor above. This, the detective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
thought, might lead to the rear room
where the talk between the diamond merchant and
the sailor was in progress. He mounted the steps
halfway and paused, listening for the sound of
voices. As he waited, he thought with wonder at
the position in which he found himself.</p>

<p>That a New York merchant of the apparent respectability
of Hartley should occupy a place of
business set with a man trap of the character
which had caught him was incredible enough, but
that he should actually bring it into use was almost
beyond belief. It meant much to the detective.
It showed him that the establishment was
one in which such devices were considered necessary
to the business of the proprietor, and therefore
one which should be broken up by the police.
It was almost incredible that such a den should
exist within a few blocks of Broadway.</p>

<p>Presently the sound of voices came to the ears
of the listening detective. First he heard the
smooth tones of the merchant saying:</p>

<p>“You have betrayed me, and you cannot deceive
me again. The best thing you can do is to leave
the country, and leave it at once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>“’Ow can we get hoff without th’ coin? Tell
me that!” answered the voice of the sailor. “Hi’ll
split on the game if we don’t get hour hown.”</p>

<p>“What have you done with the diamonds?” demanded
the merchant.</p>

<p>Nick bent forward eagerly.</p>

<p>At last his quest was to be crowned with results.</p>

<p>What diamonds could be meant save the ones
stolen from the Maynard home?</p>

<p>“Hi gave them to the bloomin’ toff you sent
hup there,” was the angry reply.</p>

<p>“That is not true,” said the merchant. “You
gave him a counterfeit package, and stood by
while he packed it in the trunk and checked the
trunk. From the moment the trunk was closed in
your presence it was never opened again until it
was brought here. You stole the diamonds, and
now you try to blackmail me.”</p>

<p>“This is something like!” thought Nick. “The
diamonds were placed in the trunk, as I supposed,
and shipped here. Hartley says he never
received them. Sailor says he delivered them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the agent. Now, which one lies, and where are
the diamonds?”</p>

<p>“Hit’s a lie!” shouted the sailor. “Your bloomin’
pirate got the gems.”</p>

<p>“You talk of splitting on the game,” continued
the merchant. “What do you know of the murder
which took place at the Maynard house on the
night of your visit there?”</p>

<p>“That’s gaff!”</p>

<p>“Gaff, is it?” demanded Hartley. “Read the
newspapers when you go out and see if I speak the
truth. Maynard was murdered in his bed on the
night you secured the diamonds. You’ll both find
yourselves in the electric chair if you say too
much about the affair.”</p>

<p>“S’lp me!” cried the sailor, “Hi don’t know of
any murder. Hi——”</p>

<p>The merchant interrupted him.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to know anything about it,” he
said. “I merely repeat my former advice, which
is to get out of the country.”</p>

<p>Nick waited in vain for the sailor to go on.
What words were on his tongue when so suddenly
checked? He made general denial. Who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
then, had murdered Alvin Maynard? Where
were the diamonds?</p>

<p>Nick was listening to the voice of one of the
men who had stolen the gems, yet he was no
nearer a solution of the murder mystery than before.
He believed what the man said regarding
the murder. He had not even known of it until
informed by the merchant. Even now he seemed
to doubt the truth of the statement.</p>

<p>“I’ll land him in the Tombs when he leaves
here,” thought Nick, “and we’ll see about the
murder later. It is possible that, after all, he
knows where the diamonds are, and yet, men of
his character don’t usually hang about for a little
money when in the possession of half a million in
diamonds.”</p>

<p>But Nick’s plans were defeated by something
which happened on the floor above. He heard a
quick blow, a fall, and then the groans of a man
in agony. As he was about to spring up the stairs
and through the door at the top, the sound of
another voice came to his ears:</p>

<p>“How was that for a knockout?”</p>

<p>It was the coarse voice of a bully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very well done,” replied the merchant. “Put
him in the shaft with his mate.”</p>

<p>“Croak him?” asked the other.</p>

<p>“No; fix him up so that he won’t know his own
name when he is able to be about again,” was the
reply.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.
<br />
<small>DEATH COMES TOO SOON.</small></h2>


<p>“So that he won’t know his own name when he
is able to be about again!”</p>

<p>Nick knew very well what that meant. The
sailor was to be beaten, and imprisoned, and
drugged, and frightened, until he became crazed;
and then turned out into the world again. Even
if some faint glimmerings of what had taken
place should come to him, no one would credit the
statement of a half-crazed sailor, who, as would
be believed, came by his infirmity on the high
seas and had forgotten!</p>

<p>“It is devilish!” muttered the detective. “I
wonder how I am going to get at the fellow before
they quite kill his intelligence?”</p>

<p>Locked in the unconscious brain of the sailor
was the story of the taking of the diamonds, if
not the story of the murder of Alvin Maynard.</p>

<p>If he could only communicate with Patsy, sitting
there in the saloon with the other party to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
robbery! If Patsy only knew, then the whole
thing would be easy.</p>

<p>The fact that the diamond merchant had been
implicated in the robbery could not aid the detective
at that time. He had no proof except the
words of the sailor he had heard while listening
on the stairs. But all in good time the necessary
evidence would be found, he was certain of that.</p>

<p>Nick might now do one of two things.</p>

<p>One was to remain in the basement, and get to
the sailor after he had been dumped down the
shaft. Wounded and in fear of death, the man
would be likely to tell all he knew about the diamond
robbery.</p>

<p>The other was to force his way out of the
basement and take the sailor with Patsy into custody.
This man probably knew as much of the
affair as the other.</p>

<p>After studying the matter over, Nick decided
to remain and assist the sailor out of the den he
was in. The other man might prove sullen and
refuse to talk after being placed under arrest. Besides,
humanity prompted the detective to help the
wounded sailor. Only that such a course would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
have placed Hartley on his guard and defeated all
his plans, Nick would have beaten down the door
and rushed to the rescue of the sailor then and
there. In fact, this was his first idea, but he
quickly saw that to do so would be to imperil the
success of the case.</p>

<p>But it was not entirely in the hope of recovering
the diamonds that the detective decided to remain
where he was.</p>

<p>There might be peril in remaining, but there
were things to be cleared up of more importance
than the recovery of the diamonds.</p>

<p>The sailor might be able to throw some light on
the strange murder of Alvin Maynard.</p>

<p>At least he would be able to tell how the diamonds
had been secured, and to explain the situation
in the house at the time of his visit.</p>

<p>He was positive that the robbers had not passed
beyond Anton’s room, and he wanted an account
of what had taken place there.</p>

<p>There were many things to be explained, and
the sailors were the only ones who would be apt
to tell the truth.</p>

<p>Presently a noise like that made by dragging a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
heavy body over the floor came from the private
room just over Nick’s head.</p>

<p>The paid assassin of the diamond merchant was
about to complete his task.</p>

<p>Just at this moment the workmen employed at
the front of the basement extinguished their light
and went away. Their departure gave Nick an
opportunity to work out a plan which had been
forming in his brain.</p>

<p>The sailor was undoubtedly badly wounded
now, and would, of course, be still further hurt by
a long drop into the sub-basement.</p>

<p>Nick wanted to get at the man while he was in
good shape—while he could talk of the events of
the previous night.</p>

<p>A long board lay on one of the packing boxes,
and the detective took this and carried it to the
shaft.</p>

<p>“I’ll switch the victim off their trunk line to
death or insanity,” thought Nick, “if my usual
luck will hold for a few minutes.”</p>

<p>The board was wide as well as long, and perfectly
smooth on one side. Bracing one end
against the wall of the shaft opposite the door,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the detective placed the other against a heavy box,
which he dragged up to the dark doorway.</p>

<p>“Now, my cunning friends,” he mused, “your
sailor will strike this slanting board when you
dump him into the shaft and be shunted into this
basement. I hope they will dump him in without
throwing a flash of light into the shaft. That
might spoil everything, as it would disclose the
presence of the board and might make it necessary
for me to do a little shooting.”</p>

<p>Satisfied as to the utility of his plan, the detective
stood in the open doorway, and waited.
Before long he heard a sound at the trapdoor
above, and a gleam of light appeared. Nick almost
held his breath. If they should take a notion
to look down the shaft, his plans would be ruined.
But they did not. It was a gruesome place at
best, and the associations were probably far from
pleasant, so they just lifted the trap in the floor
above and threw the sailor down.</p>

<p>Nick knew by the movements above, plainly
heard as being directly over his head, that the
man had been taken from the rear room to the hall
and there disposed of. It was pitch dark in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
basement, so those above could not see that the
door was open.</p>

<p>In a second the unconscious man came tumbling
down, and Nick stood ready to direct the fall into
the basement where he stood. The man struck
the plank, which gave a trifle under the weight,
and slid swiftly toward the door. There was not
room on either side of the plank to fall off.</p>

<p>“This is great business for the heart of New
York City,” thought Nick, as he caught the sailor
in his arms. “Now, I wonder how badly this
man is injured?”</p>

<p>He flashed a gleam from his flash on the man’s
face, which was covered with blood, and saw that
his eyes were opening. Then the man raised his
head and tried to speak. The detective lifted him
higher and bent his ear to catch the sound.</p>

<p>“There was no killin’,” the man muttered.</p>

<p>“But the man up there is dead,” whispered
Nick, in the man’s ear. “Who did the killing?”</p>

<p>“We did not,” was the faint reply.</p>

<p>“Where did you get the diamonds?” asked
Nick, seeing that the man had been fatally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
wounded by the savage blow of the bully, and
could not last much longer.</p>

<p>“We watched an’ got them from——”</p>

<p>That was all. It was only a dead man that lay
in the detective’s arms. The sailor had died with
the secret on his lips, when one more word would
have set everything straight.</p>

<p>There was now but one thing for the detective
to do, and that was to reach Patsy and the other
sailor, and take the latter into custody. He was
guilty only of robbery, and might be induced to
tell the truth by promises of leniency. Besides,
he would doubtless be greatly enraged at the murder
of his companion, and this might cause him
to relate not only the events of the night at the
Maynard house, but also the deal with Hartley.
For the murder of the sailor, Hartley and the
bully could be called to account later.</p>

<p>Nick ascended the stairs to the rear room, listened
at the door, opened it a trifle, and looked inside.
There was no one there, and the only light
came through a transom over the door leading
to the store. Crossing the room softly, Nick came
to a door opening into the hall. It was through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
this doorway that the sailor had been carried on
the way to the shaft.</p>

<p>Nick lifted the trap and looked down. All was
dark and still below, and a swirl of foul air came
up into his face. His flash showed the board to
be in position.</p>

<p>“I came near making a blunder there,” he
mused. “If they see that they will know that
their secret is known, and flee. I must go back.”</p>

<p>The detective hastened to the basement, returned
the board to the place from which it had
been taken, and arranged the body so as to give
the impression that it had fallen through the doorway
instead of proceeding down the shaft. Then
he opened a door leading to the sub-basement, left
the door to the store floor open, and passed on to
the hall again.</p>

<p>“They will never suspect that the sailor did not
fall into the first basement,” he thought, “and they
may believe that I found my way out of the place
where they dumped me, or thought they dumped
me. However, we must get the bully under lock
and key as soon as possible. It is the electric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
chair for him. Hartley must be watched until we
know more about the diamond deal.”</p>

<p>At the rear of the hall in which Nick now found
himself, a staircase led to the second floor. As
Nick started to ascend it in the darkness, a man
came rushing down and almost fell over him.
Nick quickly stepped aside, and the fellow, who
was panting as from a long run or a struggle,
passed on to the door of the rear room, and entered.</p>

<p>While Nick waited, wondering if it was now
safe to attempt the ascent of the stairs, there was
a rush of feet in the store in front and angry
voices came to the ears of the listener.</p>

<p>“I tell you he came in here,” Nick heard a voice
say. “You’ve hidden him somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Some street row,” thought Nick.</p>

<p>All was still on the second floor when Nick
reached the head of the stairs, and in a moment
he was in the street. About the first person he
saw there was Patsy. There was an excited crowd
in front of the store, and policemen were guarding
the door.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Nick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“They did up my sailor,” was the reply.
“Where is your man?”</p>

<p>“Dead,” was the reply. “And yours?”</p>

<p>“Gone to the hospital with a smash on the head
that would have killed an ox,” was the reply. “I
don’t think he’ll ever get over it.”</p>

<p>“How did it happen?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“Well, we got tired of waiting for you, and
came and stood in front of the shop, here. Presently
a tough mug of a fellow came out and looked
us over. Then he went back and whispered with
the clerk, and a gray-haired man was called into
the conversation. We could see them through the
window, and noted that they were all very much
excited.”</p>

<p>Nick began to understand.</p>

<p>“Then the tough mug came out and began picking
a quarrel with us. The sailor was drunk and
made a dash at him. He got a thump on the head
that will hold him for a long time, I reckon, and
then the tough came at me. I gave him one in
the eye, and he turned and ran away. I think he
went up the stairway, but the mob says he went
into the store.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“He is probably cursing the clerk good and
plenty by this time,” said Nick. “I figure it out
that the clerk thought he dumped the other sailor’s
partner when he dumped me, and so imagined
that both were provided for. Then, when
the bully saw the other one on the street with you,
he understood that something must be done, for
he knew too much about the diamond deal, and
would be making inquiries for his partner, who
had entered this place not long before.”</p>

<p>“And his partner is dead?” asked Patsy.</p>

<p>“Dead down there in the cellar,” said Nick.</p>

<p>“And the bully thought that both parties to
the diamond deal were down there, all safe and
beyond the power of harm?”</p>

<p>“That is about it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Patsy, “if one is dead, the rascals
are safe for a time, all right, for the other will
not be out of the hospital for a long time, and may
not know his own name when he does come out.
He got a fierce smash on the front of the head.”</p>

<p>“It was evidently the purpose to craze the
man,” said Nick. “That seems to be a cheerful
way these fellows have. Well, this leaves us in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
bad shape. I know now that the two sailors took
the diamonds from the Maynard house, but I
don’t know where the diamonds are any more
than I did an hour ago. Again, these men might
have thrown some light on the murder of Alvin
Maynard. That is now impossible, for one is
dead and the other may never regain his senses.”</p>

<p>“This man Hartley seems to be playing a close
game,” said Patsy. “Dumped you, did they?”</p>

<p>Nick explained very briefly what had taken
place in Hartley’s establishment.</p>

<p>“So the diamonds are actually lost?” asked
Patsy.</p>

<p>“It seems so,” was the reply. “The sailors got
them, in what manner I hope soon to learn, and
turned them over to the agent. The agent put
them in his trunk in their presence and checked
them to New York. When the trunk got to Hartley’s
the diamonds were gone, and a counterfeit
package lay in the trunk. And it seems that both
the sailor and the agent went to Hartley for their
pay, which they would not have done if they had
played him false. It is a great mix-up, and the
finding of the men who took the diamonds from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the house seems to have little bearing on the finding
of the man who killed Alvin Maynard.”</p>

<p>“There must be some common-sense solution,”
said Patsy.</p>

<p>“I have thought,” said Nick, “that the sailors
took from the house a package supposed to contain
the diamonds, but I can’t imagine them traveling
to the station and turning over what they
had to the agent without knowing whether they
had the gems or not. They would not trust to
appearances—such men never do.”</p>

<p>“Chick may learn something up at the Maynard
house,” suggested Patsy.</p>

<p>“In the meantime,” said Nick, “we ought to
get our hand on that bully and lock him up. But
this should be done without letting Hartley know
that he has been arrested. Now, I am going up to
the Maynard house to-night, and I want you to
manage the arrest of the bully. String a line of
men around the whole block, if necessary, but <em>get
him</em>! I’ll be back in the morning. And, when
you arrest the fellow, don’t let him communicate
with any one. Hartley would make a jump for
liberty that might give us a long chase.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>It was eight o’clock when the detective left a
train at the little suburban railroad station. Chick
stood on the platform waiting for him.</p>

<p>“What’s the news?” asked the chief.</p>

<p>“Unless I am much mistaken,” was the reply,
“the diamonds are still about the house. If they
are not, there are a lot of lunatics up there.”</p>

<p>“For instance?”</p>

<p>“Well, Mrs. Maynard seems to have recovered
from her fits. At any rate, she sits in the parlor
and watches Anton every minute of the time. If
he goes to his room she makes an errand upstairs.
If he goes out into the grounds she is not
far away.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Nick.</p>

<p>“And Anton seems to be keeping his eye on the
maid, Bernice. He goes where she is as often as
he decently can, and once I heard them quarreling
in the shrubbery.”</p>

<p>“Then you think Mrs. Maynard suspects Anton?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know if she suspects him of the robbery
and the murder, but I believe she thinks he
knows all about the events of that night. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
know she was about the house herself, and took
the diamonds from the trunk.”</p>

<p>“That is the way we figured it out this morning,”
said Nick, thinking of the girl Anton had
inquired for at the depot.</p>

<p>“I guess that is settled,” said Chick.</p>

<p>“Nothing is settled until the case is ended,” replied
Nick. “For instance, you speak of the diamonds
being here in the house at this moment.
What if I tell you that I heard a man admit taking
them and turning them over to one of Hartley’s
agents?”</p>

<p>“Is that a fact?” asked Chick, in surprise.</p>

<p>Nick then related, in brief, the story of the
afternoon’s work.</p>

<p>“Here is the mystery,” said Chick. “How did
the men get the diamonds? They did not penetrate
the house farther than the west room. Who
gave them the gems, then? And who killed Alvin
Maynard? Again, the burglars were not in a position
to do it! They never got to that front room.
Were there two sets of criminals in the house last
night, each acting with a different purpose in
view?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Nick smiled, but attempted no explanation.</p>

<p>He had his own notion about things, but he
was not ready to tell the story of the crime, even
to his assistant.</p>

<p>The detectives were now walking side by side
under the orchard trees, perhaps fifty yards back
of the house. They had followed the track taken
in the morning.</p>

<p>It was a moonlight night, but there were heavy
banks of clouds in the sky, and now and then the
landscape was in darkness.</p>

<p>“Here we are at the path leading to the house,”
said Nick, “and we may as well find out what
Charley Maynard is thinking of. How does he
take the loss of his diamonds now that the excitement
has worn off?”</p>

<p>“Like the sensible fellow that he is,” was the
reply. “And it has been discovered that he is not
broke if he never gets the diamonds. He was Alvin’s
favorite, and the old man was rich. Charley
gets a couple of millions.”</p>

<p>“Then he can well afford to take the matter
coolly,” said Nick, “for——”</p>

<p>But the sentence was never finished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Two revolver shots came from a thicket in the
orchard.</p>

<p>Then, in the moonlight, two spiral puffs of
smoke crept upward.</p>

<p>It was a close call, but the bullets did no harm.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.
<br />
<small>AT FOUR O’CLOCK.</small></h2>


<p>“That was going some,” said Chick coolly.</p>

<p>Nick did not wait to make reply. He rushed
the thicket whence the shots had come, but arrived
too late to find the would-be murderer there.
When Chick reached the spot, he found his chief
down on his knees examining the earth, lantern
in hand.</p>

<p>As the assistant came up, Nick shut off the
flash, and moved away from the spot.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Chick, “that shows that there are
people about here who are implicated in the happenings
of last night. They evidently think we
are getting too inquisitive.”</p>

<p>Nick walked on toward the house without making
reply. He was thinking fast. Once more
his clues were pointing in a contrary direction.</p>

<p>“Those shots were intended to defend the murderer
and not the diamond thief,” he mused.
“Now, I wonder if the people up here have fallen
into my trap?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Arrived at the house, Nick and Chick, after a
moment’s conversation with Mrs. Maynard and
Charley, proceeded to the second floor of the mansion.
Nick stopped at the head of the stairs with
a smile on his face. The stairs and the halls had
been swept and washed during the day, thus removing
every trace of the record left by naked
feet the night before.</p>

<p>Nick hastened to the closet in Anton’s room.
When he came out again, the smile on his face
had broadened. His next move was to visit the
hallway used by the servants in reaching the rooms
over the main part of the house. This, too, had
been cleaned, and tiny marks which Nick had
observed on the door in the morning had been
obliterated. In one place the paint had been
partially rubbed from the door casing in scrubbing
off a stain. The detective turned toward the
lower part of the house.</p>

<p>“The case up here is closed,” he said.</p>

<p>Chick opened his eyes, but said nothing.</p>

<p>Nick went to the back end of the house and
asked for Bernice.</p>

<p>“She’s gone,” said one of the servants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“Gone where?”</p>

<p>“To the city,” was the reply.</p>

<p>Nick smiled and turned away. He remembered
distinctly of having caught a glimpse of the
girl at one of the upper windows just before entering
the orchard, perhaps five minutes before
the shooting.</p>

<p>“She went away two hours ago,” said the servant,
a young girl who seemed devoted to the maid.
“I saw her take the train.”</p>

<p>Nick thought he knew why the girl had been
hiding in the house, and why she had instructed
the servant to tell of her departure. He turned to
his assistant.</p>

<p>“Bernice may try to take the next train,” he
said. “Now, I want to talk with her before she
gets off, and I wish you would watch the depot
and see that she remains here at least until morning.”</p>

<p>“But she has already gone,” said Chick.</p>

<p>“You may find her hiding about the station,”
said Nick. “The girl is frightened half to death.
Anton thinks she has the diamonds.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand,” said Chick, but Nick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
would talk no more, so the assistant set out to the
depot.</p>

<p>Nick then asked for Mrs. Maynard, and together
they ascended to the maid’s room. The old
lady was trembling violently, and it was with difficulty
that Nick got her into the room. The results
of the interview were far-reaching.</p>

<p>“Where is Bernice?” asked the old lady, at the
close of the talk.</p>

<p>“She is waiting to get to New York,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>“Yes, she asked permission to go, some time in
the afternoon,” said the old lady, “and it was
granted. The poor girl is half crazed.”</p>

<p>Nick smiled and escorted Mrs. Maynard back
to the parlor.</p>

<p>“The case is clearing,” he thought. “If I only
had a line on the whereabouts of the diamonds!”</p>

<p>At this moment Charley Maynard entered the
parlor, which Nick was about to leave.</p>

<p>“There are strange doings about here,” he said.
“Who did the shooting?”</p>

<p>“All in good time,” said Nick. “There is little
use in discussing suspicions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you think the diamonds are still in this
house?” asked the young man.</p>

<p>“I know that they are not,” was the reply.</p>

<p>In a few words Nick explained the events of
the afternoon in the city. Charley gave an exclamation
of vexation.</p>

<p>“If the sailors stole the diamonds,” he said,
“and gave them to the agent, and some one unknown
and untraceable stole them from the agent,
what chance do I have of ever getting them back?
If the sailors, who were in the house for a felonious
purpose, did not murder my uncle, who did?
I think we are further from the end of the case
than when we began.”</p>

<p>“If I have my usual luck,” replied Nick, “you
shall hear the end of the case before another
sunrise.”</p>

<p>“Then you must know exactly what you are
doing,” said Charley. “I am sure that no one else
does.”</p>

<p>“Right you are,” replied Nick. “There is one
chance in two that I have located the diamonds.
Be patient until the time for the disclosure
comes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Charley went grumbling off to his room, and
Nick sat on the porch or wandered about in the
moonlight until three o’clock. Then he went toward
the station, taking a roundabout path. He
had heard nothing from Chick since he had left
the house early in the evening.</p>

<p>The detective did not go straight to the station,
but stopped in a thicket of evergreens that
bordered a fence not far from the little railroad
house. From his hiding place he had a full view
of the back of the building, and also of the window
of the little store under which so many things
had taken place the night before. As Nick lay
down to await the arrival of the train, Chick crept
up and laid a hand on his arm.</p>

<p>“I saw you coming,” he said. “What’s new up
at the house?”</p>

<p>“The end of the case lies here,” said Nick. “We
have done with the house end of the murder and
the robbery.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve got me guessing,” said Chick.</p>

<p>“Did the maid show up?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“She’s hanging about in the shrubbery somewhere.
Why should she do that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“She’s afraid she’ll be arrested for doing the
shooting, and for other things,” said Nick.</p>

<p>“She do the shooting!” said Chick. “Impossible!”</p>

<p>“Don’t form conclusions, yet,” said Nick.</p>

<p>“It appears to me that you are doing that very
thing,” said Chick.</p>

<p>“The girl hasn’t seen you, has she?” asked
Nick.</p>

<p>“I think not. I have not been out in the open,
and she has usually been between me and the station.
She’s shy of being seen, I can tell you
that.”</p>

<p>“Now,” said Nick, “the train is coming. Move
down to the front, keeping out of sight, and get
where you can see the whole length of the line of
cars. If a man gets off, you follow him, but keep
out of sight. If I point to any person who gets on
the train, jump aboard and arrest him before the
arrival at New York.”</p>

<p>“If the girl joins him?” asked Chick. “I presume
that is what all this means.”</p>

<p>“The girl will not join him,” was the reply.
“She may try to, but she will not succeed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who is this man?” asked Chick.</p>

<p>Nick laughed.</p>

<p>“To be honest with you,” he said, “I don’t know
that there is any man. The girl may be waiting
here to sneak away on the train, though it seems
strange that she would wait until this hour, when
early trains stop here. A girl met a man here last
night, and she may meet him again to-night. It
looks to me as if that girl was Bernice. We shall
soon know if I have doped the case wrong. Here
comes the train.”</p>

<p>Chick glided through the shrubbery, and came
out at the front of the locomotive, keeping under
the headlight. By moving about a little he could
see along both sides of the line of cars. Presently
he saw a man step off the smoking-car platform,
on the side opposite the station. He dodged the
lighted windows and ducked away to the right,
where a patch of bushes hid a view of the field
beyond. Chick was not far behind him. He was
wondering if Nick was prepared for this, but in
a moment he understood.</p>

<p>Bernice came out of the copse to meet the man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and a rustle of bushes off to the right told Chick
that his chief was there, observing the interview.</p>

<p>Chick could not get near enough to hear what
was being said, but it looked to him as if Nick
was better placed. As the starting bell rang,
Chick saw the man take something from his purse
and pass it over to Bernice.</p>

<p>Then the man moved toward the train, with the
girl facing in the same direction.</p>

<p>Chick then saw his chief rise up out of the
bushes and point to the man who was making for
the train. As the fellow sprang upon the lighted
platform, Chick mounted the steps of the now
moving train, and took a seat in the smoker. He
was bound to obey orders, though he knew little of
the significance of his own actions.</p>

<p>As the train moved off, Bernice skirted the
station building and started off toward the house
at a swift walk. Nick, who had heard considerable
of the girl’s talk with the man, followed close
behind her.</p>

<p>Arriving on the house grounds, she passed
around to the kitchen door, which was opened at
her knock. Some one had evidently been waiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
for her. Nick moved up to a window, and looked
in. The servant girl he had before talked with
stood in front of the maid, a lighted lamp in her
hand. The maid’s hand bag lay on a table between
them.</p>

<p>As Nick waited, the girls moved into the pantry,
as if to get a luncheon, and Nick hastened
back to the door, which he found unfastened.</p>

<p>The lamp was still in the pantry when the detective
opened the outer door and looked into the
kitchen. He crept in, seized the hand bag, and
hastened out again.</p>

<p>Stationing himself at the window again, Nick
saw the girls leave the pantry.</p>

<p>“I thought I heard a noise out here,” said Bernice.</p>

<p>“It was the wind,” said the girl, offering the
usual threadbare explanation.</p>

<p>Bernice approached the table.</p>

<p>“Where is my hand bag?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I haven’t got it,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“You saw me lay it here?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Some one has stolen it,” said the maid, terror<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
showing in her face. “Have you seen Anton
about here to-night?”</p>

<p>“He has not been here,” was the reply. “Do
you think he would steal it?”</p>

<p>“I am sure of it,” replied the maid. “Oh, what
shall I do? It means ruin to lose that hand bag
now!”</p>

<p>“You can buy another,” said the girl stupidly.</p>

<p>“But the contents!” cried the maid. “I can’t
replace them!”</p>

<p>“Shall I go to Anton’s room and see if he is
there?” asked the girl.</p>

<p>“Yes—no! Oh, what shall I do? Perhaps I
had better go myself.”</p>

<p>Bernice moved away, followed by the servant,
and Nick opened the kitchen door again, and entered.
He followed the girls through the dining
room into a hall from which ran the stairs connecting
with the servants’ hall on the second floor.</p>

<p>Bernice mounted the stairs and soon stood at
the door which opened into the main hall, which
ran in front of the room where the murder had
been committed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can’t bear to go in there,” Nick heard her
whisper.</p>

<p>“The body is not there,” said the servant. “It
is in the large room back of the library, and the
watchers are there with it.”</p>

<p>Bernice opened the door and started in. Then
she shrank back, and said to the girl:</p>

<p>“You go, Nancy, and see if there is a light in
Anton’s room.”</p>

<p>The girl returned presently, and said that there
was a light there.</p>

<p>“Then you remain here,” said Bernice, “and
I’ll go and see him. Don’t you stir until I return.
Oh, what shall I do?”</p>

<p>Nick heard the girl sobbing convulsively for a
moment after she was left alone. He waited no
longer.</p>

<p>He advanced to where the girl stood, lamp in
hand, and said:</p>

<p>“Go and awake your mistress and ask her to
come to the parlor.”</p>

<p>“But I was told to remain here,” said the loyal
servant.</p>

<p>“Bernice will be down in a moment,” said Nick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>As he spoke, the door of Anton’s room opened,
and the young man and the maid looked out.</p>

<p>“What’s wanted?” asked Anton.</p>

<p>“You are wanted in the parlor, both of you,”
replied Nick. “Go on, little girl, and tell your
mistress to come.”</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” asked Bernice.</p>

<p>“Come to the parlor and find out,” replied Nick,
stepping to the door of the room occupied by
Charley and knocking on the panels.</p>

<p>“Wake up, Charley,” he cried, “and come to the
parlor. Your diamonds have been found. Oh,
you are dressed!” added Nick, opening the door.
“I thought you went to bed to get some sleep!”</p>

<p>“Sleep!” cried the young man; “I have been
watching that door all night!”</p>

<p>He pointed to Anton’s door.</p>

<p>“You have?” cried Anton. “Why should you
watch my door?”</p>

<p>“Never mind that,” said Nick. “The truth is
out, and the story will be told in the parlor. You
watched the wrong door, Charley.”</p>

<p>A few moments later an interesting group assembled
in the great parlor of the Maynard country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
house. Mrs. Maynard, Bernice, the small
servant girl, Charley Maynard, and Anton, with
the detective, constituted the party.</p>

<p>Bernice was deadly pale. Her eyes glared
strangely about the room, and her hands trembled
violently. Anton took a chair at her side, and
seemed anxious to restore her self-command.</p>

<p>Mrs. Maynard looked with averted eyes at the
couple. Charley was cool, as usual, but his eyes
were fixed reprovingly on the maid.</p>

<p>“You stated that the diamonds had been found,”
he said, turning to Nick. “I have suspected all
along that they never left the house.”</p>

<p>“Is that the reason why you watched Anton’s
door to-night?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“It is,” was the reply.</p>

<p>Anton sprang excitedly to his feet.</p>

<p>“Remain quiet,” said Nick. “There is no need
of temper here.”</p>

<p>“The coward!” cried Anton. “To insult me
here in the presence of my mother!”</p>

<p>“You were wrong in supposing that the diamonds
were in the house,” said Nick to Charley.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
“They were removed by two burglars last night,
and are now in New York.”</p>

<p>“Have the burglars been caught?” asked Anton
eagerly.</p>

<p>“They have,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“And have confessed?” asked Charley.</p>

<p>Anton sank back in his chair.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it,” declared Bernice.</p>

<p>“Where are the diamonds located?” asked
Charley.</p>

<p>Nick opened his pocketbook and took out a key
to which was attached a brass tag.</p>

<p>“You stole my hand bag!” shouted Bernice.</p>

<p>Nick looked up with a smile on his face.</p>

<p>“One thing at a time,” he said. “Your diamonds,
Charley, are now located in deposit vaults
on Broadway, in box number three thousand eight
hundred and seventy-nine, and this is the key
thereof.”</p>

<p>Bernice looked like a girl about to commit
murder.</p>

<p>“You thief!” she cried. “You stole my hand
bag!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Nick, “I did steal your hand bag.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
It is down in the kitchen, behind the range. I
have no further use for it.”</p>

<p>“Did you get this key from her hand bag?”
demanded Charley.</p>

<p>Nick nodded.</p>

<p>“Then she stole the diamonds,” said Charley.</p>

<p>“You are wrong,” said the detective. “She did
not steal the diamonds, but she was prepared to
do so, and she concealed all knowledge of their
whereabouts, for she knew this morning where
they were.”</p>

<p>“It is false!” shouted Bernice. “Do you get
us all up in the night to tell us of these things? It
is all a lie!”</p>

<p>“You will be claiming, presently,” said Anton,
“that I murdered Alvin Maynard.”</p>

<p>“You did,” said Nick coolly.</p>

<p>Again Anton sprang to his feet, but Nick lifted
the muzzle of a revolver to his breast, and he sat
down again.</p>

<p>Mrs. Maynard bowed her head and sobbed
audibly. Charley moved nearer to the accused
man. Bernice stared like one under a spell, first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
at Mrs. Maynard and then at Anton, who sat with
his eyes fixed reproachfully on his mother.</p>

<p>Nick understood the meaning of that look, and
said:</p>

<p>“Don’t blame your mother. I knew the truth
before she confessed to the scene in the dead
man’s room last night.”</p>

<p>“You are a devil,” cried Bernice. “If I had
only shot straight.”</p>

<p>“It would have been better for you if you had
not shot at all,” said Nick, “for that was what
made me certain of your complicity in the diamond
robbery.”</p>

<p>“You lie! You lie! I know nothing about it,”
shouted the girl.</p>

<p>“Wait,” said Nick coolly, “and I will tell the
story of the robbery and the murder.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.
<br />
<small>HOW IT WAS DONE.</small></h2>


<p>“When the news that the diamonds were coming
reached the house,” began Nick, “Anton, being
without money and in debt, began figuring
how the inheritance of his cousin by marriage
could best be put to his own advantage.”</p>

<p>“That is a lie!” roared Anton.</p>

<p>“If you interrupt me again,” said Nick, “I’ll
put the handcuffs on you. You, Anton, even went
so far in your envious plotting as to speak to your
mother about the diamonds being divided.
Charley, you said, would not miss a few, and it
would be the means of saving you from disgrace.
Your mother resented the imputation on her honesty,
and resolved to see that the diamonds, when
they arrived, should be protected from thievery.</p>

<p>“The diamonds came, and your plans were not
perfected. You wanted to keep your skirts clean,
yet you wanted to profit by the inheritance of
your friend. On the night the diamonds arrived,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
you remained downstairs long after the others
were in their rooms—all except Bernice. You
did not tell me the truth when you said that you
were almost the first one on the second floor that
night.”</p>

<p>Nick then turned to the company in general as
he continued:</p>

<p>“Seeing that whatever was done must be done
at once, Anton that night confided his plans to
Bernice, proposing that he get the diamonds and
that she dispose of them in a way yet to be arranged.
Bernice consented, and Anton went to
his room to watch for a chance to steal the diamonds.
In the meantime, Charley had been given
a sleeping potion in his lemonade. This was done
by Anton doctoring up his own and deftly changing
glasses. The substitution was witnessed by
Mrs. Maynard, who then began to fear not only
for the safety of the gems, but also for the future
of her son.</p>

<p>“Anton went to his room late, after arranging
the details of the robbery with Bernice, and sat
by his door in undress, waiting for the house to
become quiet. While he sat there he heard his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
mother leave her room and cross the hall to the
apartment where the diamonds were, and where
the owner was sound asleep, with the gems unprotected
in an old trunk, which was not even
locked. Alarmed at the thought of what might
take place, Mrs. Maynard had decided to herself
take charge of the diamonds for the night. Too
loyal to her son to betray him, and thus put
Charley on his guard, she resolved to risk her own
reputation for honesty in defending the property.</p>

<p>“After a time Mrs. Maynard recrossed the hall
to her own room, leaving her son in a frame of
mind little short of desperation. All his plans had
failed! Then it was that he heard the door of his
stepfather’s room open. The old man, feeling that
something unusual was going on, had watched the
hall, and had heard his wife enter and leave
Charley’s room. That day the mother had pleaded
with her husband in the interest of her spendthrift
son, and had been refused the money favor
she asked.</p>

<p>“It was natural, then, that the old man should
believe that his wife had become a midnight thief
in order to provide her son with money. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Mrs. Maynard returned to her room Mr. Maynard
went there, light in hand, and in no gentle
frame of mind. He found the diamonds where
his wife had placed them—in a little drawer of
her dresser—accused her of stealing them, refused
to listen to any explanation, and carried the
gems off to his own room.”</p>

<p>“You are an evil spirit!” gasped Bernice. “You
have eyes in this house when you are away in
New York.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Maynard followed her husband on his
return to his room,” continued Nick. “There she
resented his charges, explained her purpose in
taking the diamonds, and demanded their return
to her custody. But she had asked for money
for her son that day, and Mr. Maynard would
not listen to her story. He believed that she had
stolen the gems for the purpose of enriching her
son at the expense of the nephew.</p>

<p>“After a time the woman tried to take the diamonds
by force, and a struggle took place, during
which she was thrown to the floor, her head striking
on the corner of the lounge, inflicting the
wound which she afterward ascribed to a blow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
from the burglar. Anton, who was watching and
listening in the hall, heard the fall, and entered
the room just in time to see Mr. Maynard bending
over his mother in a threatening attitude.</p>

<p>“Just before leaving his room he had used a
geologist’s hammer in fixing a box in which he
proposed to hide and ship the diamonds. Unconsciously
he carried this hammer in his hand when
he entered the front room. Seeing his mother
insensible on the floor, and Mr. Maynard bending
over her in an angry attitude, the young man had
every right to believe that he was acting for the
best, when he bounded forward and struck the
man a violent blow on the head. Mr. Maynard
fell dead.</p>

<p>“Alarmed at what he had done, the young man
hastened to place the body on the bed and apply
restoratives, but it was too late. He then revived
his mother and carried her back to her room.</p>

<p>“While all these events had been going on, Bernice
had been waiting at the end of the hall leading
to the servants’ quarters. She was expecting
that Anton would eventually bring her the box
containing the diamonds. When Mr. Maynard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
fell dead, Anton took the diamonds to his room,
after a distressing interview with his mother, who
was inconsolable at the death of her husband,
whose last words to her had been words of anger
and reproach. The mother protested without
avail against the larceny of the gems. Anton
was determined to profit by the events of the
night.</p>

<p>“Anton carried the diamonds to his room and
secreted them in a box in the closet. The geologist’s
hammer with which the murder had been
committed was placed on a shelf in the same
closet, after being cleared from the marks of the
blow, by wiping it on a towel which hung in the
closet. This hammer has a break on one side of
the striking surface, and this shows in the wound
on the dead man.”</p>

<p>“Is all this necessary?” asked the mother,
greatly distressed at the details of the killing of
her husband.</p>

<p>“It seems to be,” was the reply. “When Anton
closed his door, Bernice crept down the hall and
listened. She waited there until the young man’s
light was extinguished. Then she realized that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
it was not his intention to trust her with the diamonds.
You see, Anton had doubtless decided to
deny everything, not knowing that the girl had
been a witness of the murder.</p>

<p>“Then the burglars came. They had followed
the diamonds from New York, and would have
entered the house earlier, only that they understood
that something unusual was in progress on
the inside. During the absence of Anton in his
stepfather’s room they had raised a ladder to a
window of his room. One of them had looked
through the window while Anton gloated over the
diamonds.</p>

<p>“When the young man went to bed the burglars
entered the room, not knowing that Bernice
was watching at the door, of course. Anton was
not sound asleep, and sprang up at the noise they
made. He was instantly grappled with, and
finally knocked down, though not rendered entirely
unconscious, with a pair of iron knuckles. While
he lay on the floor, fearing for his life, the men,
who had seen him enter the closet with the diamonds,
searched about and secured the gems.</p>

<p>“All this time Bernice was listening at the door,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
afraid to call out for fear of inviting her own
death at the hands of the burglars, resolved not
to leave her post of observation, for the reason
that she had not entirely given up the notion of
securing the diamonds. She is a quick-witted girl,
this French maid, and her brain was busy with a
plan as she stood at the door in the dark hall.</p>

<p>“She regarded the arrival of the burglars as
opportune. Their presence in the house would
account for the murder and for the disappearance
of the diamonds. Besides, she had a plan for
securing the diamonds. When the burglars left
Anton’s room, she darted through it and climbed
down the ladder in pursuit. Anton, though not
fully recovered, knew who it was that was passing
through without stopping to offer assistance, and
at once decided that Bernice was in league with
the robbers, and had brought them to the house.</p>

<p>“Bernice followed the burglars to the railroad
station. Here they met a third man, the agent of
a diamond merchant, and she saw the diamonds
placed in charge of the third man, locked in a
trunk, and finally checked for passage on the
train. I am still at a loss to know why this was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
done, but I think the merchant considered the
gems safer there than in the pocket of any one of
the three men.</p>

<p>“Now, Bernice had a lover on the train which
would carry the diamonds away, and that lover
was no less a person than the baggageman in
whose charge the diamonds were placed. When
the train halted at the station she called him from
his car, told him what was going on, and the two
went to where the three men were still haggling
over the disposition of the diamonds. On the way
to New York this baggageman opened the trunk
and stole the diamonds. The sailors believed that
the agent stole them, the agent believed that the
sailors gave him a counterfeit package, and Hartley,
the merchant, sided with the agent. So, you
see, it all made a pretty mess.</p>

<p>“Yesterday in New York,” continued Nick,
“the baggageman stored the diamonds in a deposit
vault on Broadway, and when the train came
through here not long ago, he handed the key to
the box to Bernice. I have it here now.”</p>

<p>“But the baggageman, he have escape!” cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Bernice. “I have nothing to do with it all! I am
free—innocent!”</p>

<p>At that moment Nick was called to the telephone.
Before leaving the room he turned to Anton
and Bernice.</p>

<p>“I am going to leave you here,” he said, “although
both are under arrest. I don’t know but
you will try to escape. If you do it will be the
worse for you both. Under the circumstances, if
you behave well, I am inclined to be very lenient
with you. Will you remain here until I return?”</p>

<p>They both promised. For the first time a gleam
of hope shone in Anton’s eyes.</p>

<p>When Nick reached the phone he found Chick
at the other end.</p>

<p>“I have the baggageman under arrest,” said the
assistant.</p>

<p>“What does he say?”</p>

<p>“He says that he did not know what the box
contained.”</p>

<p>“That may be true. Have you found out
whether the diamonds are really in the vault?”
asked Nick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is impossible to locate the manager to-night,”
was the reply. “How are things at your
end?”</p>

<p>“Everything lovely,” was the reply. “Come out
on the first train.”</p>

<p>When Nick went back to the parlor he handed
Charley the key to the safety box in the Broadway
vaults.</p>

<p>“The baggageman is under arrest in New
York,” explained Nick. “Perhaps you had better
go down on an early train and see if the diamonds
are all right. He claims that he did not know
what was in the box.”</p>

<p>“He did not,” said Bernice. “I was not the
fool to tell him.”</p>

<p>“You may have made a mistake in not doing
so,” said Nick, “for he might have left the package
about in a careless manner. You have done
several injudicious things in connection with this
affair,” added Nick. “When you watched us
from the hall on the morning following the murder
you attracted attention to yourself. When
you came up and destroyed the footprints in the
hall leading to the servants’ rooms, you made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
yourself an object of suspicion. When you shot
at us from the thicket in the orchard, you admitted,
as plainly as words could have done, that
you were deeply implicated in the robbery or the
murder, or both. Under these circumstances it
was natural that you should be followed to the
station and your movements there noted. I saw
the baggageman give you the key to the deposit
box, and heard what you said to him. Your interview
with him the night before was witnessed
by the lunchman, although he could not hear what
was said at that time. It was enough for me that
you were there with him. So you see you, yourself,
supplied the clues which led to the location
of the gems.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with me now?” demanded
the girl.</p>

<p>“I have done my work in the case,” replied the
detective. “I have located the diamonds, and I
have discovered how Alvin Maynard came to his
death. The case is now in the hands of the sheriff
and the State’s attorney.”</p>

<p>“Remember your promise to me,” interrupted
Mrs. Maynard. “You promised not to be too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
hard on my son and Bernice if I told you what I
knew of the affair.”</p>

<p>“I shall recommend leniency,” replied Nick,
“but I knew all the facts before you told me your
story. The geologist’s hammer with which the
blow was struck was found in Anton’s closet yesterday
morning, but I did not remove it. I was
not certain at that time that it was the instrument
of death. During my absence in New York the
young man removed it, thus showing that he had
an interest in concealing clues pointing to the
murderer. Again, I learned on my first inspection
of the closet that the stolen diamonds had for a
time been secreted in a box in the closet. One
of the gems had broken away from its fastening
and was found in the box. The box and the diamond
were also removed during my absence. Instead
of covering up his tracks, the young man
was only supplying more proof against himself. I
think the burglars must have seen Anton carry
the diamonds to the closet on his return from the
front of the house, for they appeared to have
found them with little trouble.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to turn me over to the sheriff?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
asked Anton, his face deadly pale, his lips quivering,
his brain whirling at the contemplation of
the case against him.</p>

<p>“I shall be obliged to do that,” said Nick, “but
I don’t see how you can be convicted of murder,
for you certainly had a right to strike when you
believed your mother to be in peril. Bernice will
be held as accessory after the fact only, for I shall
not press the charge of attempted murder, though
she might have killed Chick or myself. I shall be
lenient for the sake of this poor old lady.”</p>

<p>At this moment a knocking was heard at the
door, and Charley admitted the sheriff.</p>

<p>“I followed a false clue,” he said to Nick.
“What luck here?”</p>

<p>“The diamonds have been recovered in New
York,” replied Nick, “and the death of Mr. Maynard
is no longer a mystery. I have two prisoners
here, Anton Sawtelle and Bernice. I ask you
to take them into custody and keep them prisoners
in this house until the State’s attorney can be
consulted.”</p>

<p>The detective did not consider it necessary to
tell the whole story to the sheriff, but the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
consented to do as requested. In a few moments
the house was dark, and Nick slept soundly until
eight o’clock in the morning, when he was awakened
by Chick.</p>

<p>“How are things in New York?” asked the
chief.</p>

<p>“Both Hartley and the bully murderer are under
arrest,” replied Chick, “and the sailor at the
hospital is in a fair way to recover. He got a
wicked blow, however.”</p>

<p>“They have run their course,” said Nick.</p>

<p>“The baggageman puts up the biggest yell,”
said Chick. “He says that he did not know that
there had been a robbery; that he did not know
that there were diamonds in the package, and that
he only did a favor for Bernice.”</p>

<p>“When baggagemen break open trunks as a
favor to their sweethearts,” said Nick, “it is time
that they were called down.”</p>

<p>“It was a pretty mess,” said Chick. “The burglars
seemed to happen along just in time to turn
suspicion from members of the household. Anton
and Bernice put up the job to get the diamonds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
all right, but Mrs. Maynard unconsciously foiled
them for the time being.”</p>

<p>“I think Anton must be a bad sort of a chap,”
said Nick. “He would have robbed his friend of
half a million.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know whether the baggageman put
the diamonds in the safety box,” said Chick, in a
moment. “He might have opened the package,
weakened at sight of so much wealth, and carried
out the character of the case by putting a dummy
package in the box.”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Nick, “the man is under arrest,
but, for all that, it would not be so easy to again
locate the diamonds.”</p>

<p>That morning the case was laid before the
State’s attorney, and Anton and Bernice were
taken to the county jail.</p>

<p>The diamonds were found in the safety vault,
and Charley recommended leniency in the case of
the baggageman, who was charged with breaking
baggage confided to his care. It proved to be the
fact that he did not know what was in the trunk,
and that he had been made to believe that Bernice
had the right to have it opened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>The wounded sailor recovered, and was sentenced
to one year in the penitentiary for breaking
and entering. His sentence was made light because
he testified willingly against Hartley. He
said that they had followed the diamonds from
South Africa, and had applied to Hartley for
funds immediately upon their arrival in New
York.</p>

<p>The one thing the sailor would not talk about
was as to how they were able to interest Hartley
in the venture in so short a time. They arrived
on the vessel with the gems they were after, and
in an hour’s time they were working under the
instructions of the diamond merchant. This part
of the case was a mystery to all.</p>

<p>Nick Carter was abroad at the time of the trial
and sentence. Hartley, too, remained silent on
this one point, even after he had received a sentence
at Sing Sing, and the bully had been sent to
the electric chair for the murder done at the store.</p>

<p>“It was one of the strangest cases I ever handled,”
said Nick, after the matter was closed. “I
came near getting a broken head there in the diamond
store, but my usual luck protected me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
There is one point, however, that I would like to
see cleared up.”</p>

<p>“About how the sailors and Hartley got together
so quickly?”</p>

<p>“That’s it. I have my suspicions, but they are
vague.”</p>

<p>“Has Charley Maynard disposed of his diamonds?”
asked Chick.</p>

<p>“He has not,” was the reply. “I wish he
would,” added the detective soberly, “for it is not
safe to have such a fortune in so small a parcel.
The diamonds were followed from Africa. Who
knows whether the leaders in the conspiracy have
given up hope of securing them? Those sailors
never put up that job.”</p>

<p>“I think I understand what your suspicions
are regarding the combination between Hartley
and the sailors, made in an hour,” said Chick.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Nick, “it is the young man’s own
affair. I have advised him, but he only laughs
at me.”</p>

<p>“Past experiences should teach him better,”
said Chick, and so it would seem.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.
<br />
<small>MAYNARD’S FOLLY.</small></h2>


<p>But past experiences did not prove of any advantage
to Maynard, who still kept the diamonds
in his possession, greatly to the surprise of his
chum, Henry Townsend.</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you have with you over
half a million dollars in diamonds—here on the
Bowery at midnight?” asked Townsend, one night
as they sat in a popular café in the Bowery.</p>

<p>“That is the situation.”</p>

<p>“I had an idea that the gems you were handling
so carelessly were paste.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. They are the real thing.”</p>

<p>“Your entire collection?”</p>

<p>“The same.”</p>

<p>“Then you are running a fearful risk, especially
when the nature of our visit to this part of
the city is considered. How many members of
the dramatic club know that you are carrying the
diamonds in your pocket to-night?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“All of them, I take it. The gems were much
admired.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re a fool, Maynard. Why, it’s simply
tempting Providence. You alarm me.”</p>

<p>The men were taking a light luncheon in a rear
room of the café. They had attended a dress rehearsal
of a play soon to be presented in the interest
of charity by a dramatic club of which they
were both members.</p>

<p>They were now waiting at the Bowery café for
the arrival of an acquaintance, one Julius Mantelle
by name, who was to conduct them to a private
interview with a female fortune teller over
whom the city was at that time in a craze.</p>

<p>The appointment had been made that evening
during the rehearsal already mentioned, and was
for two o’clock at the woman’s rooms, not far
from the place where the young men waited.</p>

<p>“I wish you hadn’t mentioned the diamonds,”
said Maynard presently. “You have about
spoiled my evening. It makes me nervous, now
that you mention them, to think of their being
here at this time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should think it would,” said Townsend.
“How did you come to do it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they are to be used during the play, you
know, and this was the last full-dress rehearsal,
so I carried them down. Then, during the rehearsal,
this appointment was made, unexpectedly,
as you know, and I had to bring the gems
with me or leave them there with the other properties.”</p>

<p>“They would have been safer there,” urged
Townsend. “We don’t know what sort of a game
we are going up against at the den of this African
fortune teller. She is a mystery to the police, and
is surrounded by a lot of servants who would, I
actually believe, even do murder for her. We
don’t even know Mantelle, who made the appointment
for us at the hour of two in the morning—an
unusual time, to say the least. Yes, I know!
He seems to have plenty of money, and is a good
entertainer, but what else do we know about
him? It will never answer, Maynard. You must
get rid of those diamonds before we go to that
woman’s den.”</p>

<p>“But how?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let me carry them to the nearest respectable
hotel and have them placed in the vault.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I need not trouble you to do that. I can
go myself.”</p>

<p>“But it is a risk for you to go,” said Townsend.
“If you have been watched or followed,
you would never get to the hotel, while no one
would suspect me of having the diamonds. Pass
them over while no one is in the room with us.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” cried Maynard. “You are making a
mountain out of a molehill.”</p>

<p>“I have heard it said,” continued Townsend,
“that blood never washes off a diamond. The
first night these gems were in America your uncle
was murdered. A fine record those diamonds
have! Come, let me be off with them—that is, if
you can trust me with half a million.”</p>

<p>“If you think it is as serious as all that,” said
Maynard, “I’ll let you have them, but it looks like
we were getting frightened at nothing. To be
sure, Anton and Bernice were sentenced to short
terms on the recommendation of Nick Carter, and
are now both out. I saw Anton yesterday, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
came to the home of his mother, and made all
sorts of promises for the future.”</p>

<p>“And where is Bernice?”</p>

<p>“She did not return to Aunt Maynard. I think,
however, that Anton knows where she is, and
will assist her if he succeeds in getting money
from his mother.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like the pair,” said Townsend, “any
more than I like the circumstances of the night.
You certainly must get rid of the diamonds.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so, but how? If we really are in
danger, it is not safe for you to take them. Suppose
we call a cab and both go to the Wisconsin?
That’s rather a neat little hotel over on Broadway.”</p>

<p>“No, you remain here, and I’ll walk there. You
must see the necessity of not seeming to be going
away for a purpose.”</p>

<p>“All right, then. Here are the diamonds.
Hurry back.”</p>

<p>Young Maynard passed a rather bulky package
to Townsend, and the latter hurried away.
At the door of the room he paused and turned
back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll go to the Wisconsin first,” he said, “and if
there is no chance there, I’ll go on up Broadway.
You wait until I return.”</p>

<p>Townsend closed the door and walked through
the outer room to the street. As he did so, a dark,
lithe, muscular man of perhaps thirty years, who
had been standing at the cigar case for a moment,
stepped to the street door and spoke a few words
to a man standing there. Then he turned to the
cigar case again, and as he did so was accosted
by a young man as dark and as sinister of face as
himself.</p>

<p>“Well?” asked the elder man.</p>

<p>“The young fellow took them off with him.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“To a hotel.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said the other. “To the Wisconsin.
Get a cab—quick.”</p>

<p>“But the night is dark, and he is walking.”</p>

<p>“Never mind that now. Get a cab, pick up
Number Two at the corner, and drive quickly to
the Wisconsin. Number Two knows what to do
on arrival.”</p>

<p>The young man hastened away, and the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
paid for a package of cigars he had ordered and
took his departure.</p>

<p>Young Maynard waited half an hour for the
return of his friend, but he did not come. As he
was about to go in search of him, Julius Mantelle
entered the room.</p>

<p>“I am late,” said the fresh arrival, throwing
himself into a chair and ringing for an attendant.
“I met a friend out here, and he steered me up
against a jolly bunch that just let go of me.
Where is Townsend?”</p>

<p>“He was called away,” replied Maynard, becoming
every instant more anxious for his friend.
“I am expecting him every moment.”</p>

<p>When the attendant arrived, Julius ordered
brandy and cigars, and set out to make himself
at home. He was a man of sallow skin and slender
build. His eyes were dark and dull in repose,
but they flashed like those of a snake under
excitement. His nose was broad at the nostrils,
his lips were thick, his hair jet black, and curly.
He spoke English with a slight French accent.
Maynard had known him only a few weeks, having
met him at the house of a mutual acquaintance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
From that first day Mantelle had seemed to
court the acquaintance and companionship of the
young millionaire.</p>

<p>“Townsend is late,” said Mantelle presently.
“We shall miss the appointment.”</p>

<p>Maynard could hardly retain his seat in his
chair. He was fearful that his friend had come
to some injury in his service. Surely, he had
been absent long enough to have executed his
commission twice over. He was not thinking of
the appointment. He was wondering how he
could obtain news of his friend without exciting
curiosity of the man sitting there.</p>

<p>“Shall we go without him?” asked Julius, after
a time.</p>

<p>“By no means,” was the reply. “I shall wait for
a few minutes, and then look him up if he does not
return.”</p>

<p>“In that case,” said the other, “we may as well
call the appointment off. I am confoundedly
sleepy, anyway. See you to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Mantelle went away, and Maynard sprang for
the phone. Two millions in diamonds would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
appeared as small to him as did the half million
involved when it came to a question of the safety
of his friend. He began to understand now that
he had made an awful mistake in carrying the
diamonds about with him.</p>

<p>At the phone he called up the Wisconsin Hotel,
asking for the clerk. When that rather important
individual was on the wire Maynard asked:</p>

<p>“Was there a young man there within the hour
asking to leave a package in the safe until morning?”</p>

<p>“No,” came the short reply.</p>

<p>Maynard gave a brief description of his
friend’s personal appearance, and asked:</p>

<p>“Was such a person there for any purpose?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Did he make his business known?”</p>

<p>“He immediately went to one of the rooms in
response to a call left at the desk for him,” was
the answer.</p>

<p>Maynard experienced a feeling of relief, but
only for a moment.</p>

<p>“Is he there still?” he then asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>“He came down almost immediately, and went
away,” was the reply.</p>

<p>Maynard hung up the receiver, his face white
and drawn. There was still much information
to be asked at the hotel, but not by phone.</p>

<p>“Something has happened,” he thought.
“Townsend may be dead, for all I know. It was a
horrible mistake to permit him to go away alone
with the diamonds. Why should he go to a room
at the Wisconsin and leave immediately? Why
should he keep me here in suspense when he understood
how anxious I was as to the result of his
mission? I can never solve the problem alone. I
wonder if it is possible to reach Mr. Carter to-night?
I wonder if he will come?”</p>

<p>The excited young man called the detective’s
private number and waited with wildly beating
heart. Presently a response came over the wire.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Carter there?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Talking,” was the reply, much to Maynard’s
relief.</p>

<p>In a few words Maynard explained the exact
situation.</p>

<p>“I may be unnecessarily alarmed,” he said, “but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
I feel that something ought to be done at once.
Can you come?”</p>

<p>“Immediately,” was the prompt response, and
Maynard hung up the receiver to walk and worry
until the detective laid a hand on his shoulder.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.
<br />
<small>A FATAL ERRAND.</small></h2>


<p>“Now tell me about it,” said Nick, as soon as
they had gained the seclusion of a private room.</p>

<p>Maynard told the story of the night, not sparing
himself in the least.</p>

<p>The detective looked very grave.</p>

<p>“Is it serious?” asked the young man.</p>

<p>“I am afraid so,” was the reply, “but hope for
the best. We can do nothing here, so we may as
well go to the Wisconsin at once.”</p>

<p>While Maynard was cheered by the presence of
the great detective, he realized that Nick’s willingness
to respond to his call meant that the detective
feared more than the loss of the diamonds. He
would hardly have left his bed at that hour simply
for the purpose of recovering diamonds which
had been carelessly lost track of.</p>

<p>Arrived at the hotel, the detective made himself
known to the clerk, that being the surest way
of securing the attention he required. The clerk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
was at once all smiles, ready to answer all questions,
to do anything in his power to accommodate
the famous detective, whose appearance at
the hotel was forever afterward spoken of as a
notable event.</p>

<p>“First,” said Nick, “we must learn whether it
was really Townsend who came here. Describe
the young man you have reference to.”</p>

<p>“Medium build,” began the clerk; “brown hair,
light mustache, blue eyes, Roman nose, very fair
complexion.”</p>

<p>“That is the man,” said Maynard.</p>

<p>“Wait,” said Nick. “How was he dressed?”</p>

<p>“Suit of blue basket cheviot, sack coat, vest
cut high, dark-brown derby hat, wing collar, blue
four-in-hand tie with red threads in it, small diamond
pin on the tie, long cuffs with amethyst buttons,
diamond ring on the little finger of the left
hand.”</p>

<p>“That was Townsend,” said Maynard.</p>

<p>“You ought to have been a detective,” said Nick
to the clerk. “Now show us to the room to which
he was taken.”</p>

<p>“But the message which called him to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
room,” suggested Maynard. “What about that?
Who sent it, and from what place was it sent?”</p>

<p>“That we may learn of the man whom he visited,”
said Nick, and the three took the elevator
to the third floor. The halls were well lighted,
but seemed deserted, and they were alone in the
elevator, with the exception of the boy operator.</p>

<p>“The man who took the room seems to be
awake,” said the clerk, pointing to the transom
over the door of room 43. “There is a light inside.”</p>

<p>The clerk knocked on the panel of the door, but
there was no response.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he is asleep,” said the clerk. “I’ll try
him again.”</p>

<p>There was no response to the second summons,
and the detective took out his picklock. In a moment
the door flew open.</p>

<p>Nick stepped inside, then turned and faced
Maynard in the doorway. His face was paler
than usual, but there was no excitement in his
manner.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment,” he said to the young man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
“Prepare yourself for a shock before you step
into the room.”</p>

<p>“Who is there?” whispered Maynard, who
seemed to have lost the power of loud speech. “Is
he ill?”</p>

<p>The clerk brushed by the two men, and advanced
to a table which stood at the centre of the
room, and at which a figure clad only in white underclothing
was half sitting, half lying, with arms
resting on the top.</p>

<p>“Ill!” cried the clerk, in a tone of horror.
“The man is dead!”</p>

<p>Maynard sank into a chair and covered his face
with his hands. He knew only too well the form
at the table. Nick turned to the clerk, and asked:</p>

<p>“Is this the young man who was summoned to
this room by a call?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the hoarse reply.</p>

<p>“But you stated that he left the hotel almost immediately.”</p>

<p>“Some one left,” was the horrified reply, “and
that some one wore the clothes I described to you.
See! This young man has been stripped, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
there are the clothes of the man who made the exchange!”</p>

<p>There could be no doubt about it. The dead
man at the table was Townsend.</p>

<p>The grief of Maynard was pitiful.</p>

<p>“If I had only taken my chances with the diamonds,”
he muttered. “Poor Townsend, to come
to this at last! It was all my fault, Mr. Carter.
I sent him to his death!”</p>

<p>“The diamonds!” echoed the clerk. “Does this
mean robbery as well as murder?”</p>

<p>“That remains to be seen,” replied the detective.</p>

<p>As Nick spoke, he lifted from the floor a small
square of oiled silk, red in color. He held it up
for the inspection of Maynard.</p>

<p>“Were the diamonds wrapped in this?” he
asked.</p>

<p>Maynard nodded.</p>

<p>“That is only part of the wrapping,” he said.</p>

<p>“Were the diamonds of great value?” asked the
clerk.</p>

<p>“Half a million,” was the short reply. Nick
now regarded the jewels as a small part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
case. The thing to do was to locate and punish
the murderer of Henry Townsend.</p>

<p>The clerk stepped back in wonder.</p>

<p>“He should have left them in the safe,” he said.</p>

<p>“That is what he came here to do,” said the detective.
“Now, before the coroner or the police
are notified, I must search this room for some clue
to the identity of the murderer. But first, tell
me everything you know regarding the occupant
of this room, the person who murdered this poor
boy, and walked out of the hotel dressed in the
victim’s clothes. When was the room taken?”</p>

<p>“Not ten minutes before the young man you
call Townsend came.”</p>

<p>Maynard sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“Then the murderer knew where Townsend
was going when he set off on foot from the café—knew
where he was going and what he carried,
and laid a trap for him!” he cried.</p>

<p>“What was said?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“He came to the desk and asked if any one had
called for Martin Haynes. I said that there had
been no such party asked for. Then he said that
he had a message for a friend of his who might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
call there during the night. If he did call, he was
to be sent up to room forty-three. When Townsend
came in I gave him the message, and he went
up at once. I don’t know what the message was.”</p>

<p>“Townsend said nothing about leaving a parcel
in the safe when he came in?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. He seemed surprised at the message,
and went straight to the elevator.”</p>

<p>“How was the person who took this room
dressed?”</p>

<p>“All in black, including hat, tie, and frock coat.
He was a dusky sort of fellow, with black eyes
and hair; just about Townsend’s size.”</p>

<p>“Not like Townsend in feature or complexion?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” replied the clerk slowly, with
a look of perplexity growing on his face. “I can
see now,” he added, “how mistaken I was in supposing
that it was Mr. Townsend who left the
hotel. I can’t understand, however, how I came
to be so careless, for it is my duty to know what
goes on here at night.”</p>

<p>“I presume that you did not notice the person
who went out, except generally, and were deceived
by the clothes worn,” said Nick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course that is it,” was the reply, “but all
the same, I don’t make many mistakes like that.
I couldn’t keep my job if I did.”</p>

<p>“And the person who engaged the room gave
the name of Martin Haynes?” asked the detective.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Register?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Any baggage?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied the clerk. “He paid in advance
for one night, and nothing was said about
baggage.”</p>

<p>“Who occupied this room yesterday?”</p>

<p>“A young man who comes here once a week,
usually Thursday. He travels for a wholesale
house.”</p>

<p>“Does he always have this room?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then he does not leave his clothing or toilet
articles here?”</p>

<p>“He does not.”</p>

<p>“How long since has a woman occupied the
room?”</p>

<p>The clerk pondered a moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“At least two weeks,” he replied, at length. “It
may be more than that.”</p>

<p>“That is all for the present,” said Nick. “We’ll
come down presently, and look at this Mr.
Haynes’ signature on the register. By the way,
was it a very stout person?”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, he was a very slender man,”
replied the clerk.</p>

<p>“Mustache?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, a black mustache.”</p>

<p>“Hands large or small?”</p>

<p>“Quite small, sir, and sparkling with a fine
ring.”</p>

<p>“Diamond?” asked the detective.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. The real thing.”</p>

<p>“Send in the night elevator boy when you go
out,” said Nick.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.
<br />
<small>A STARTLING DISCOVERY.</small></h2>


<p>The clerk passed out of the room with an offended
air. He was loath to leave the presence of
the great detective without gaining some notion
as to his course of action in the murder case. The
elevator boy soon made his appearance, and Nick
asked:</p>

<p>“You have been on duty all night?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“You carried a slender, dark-faced person up
to this room an hour or so ago?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Nick looked at his watch. The hands pointed
to the hour of two.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me the exact time?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It was ten minutes past one when I left the
office for the elevator,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Did the person speak to you on the way up?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” was the reply. “He asked me about
the fire escape and the stairs winding about the
elevator well. Seemed afraid of fire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“About the voice? Harsh or soft?”</p>

<p>“Soft and low, sir.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes. And when did that person go down
again?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir. He did not go down in the
cage.”</p>

<p>“Did you see the person going down?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Did you see him pass through the office?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. It was late, and I guess I was asleep
in the elevator.”</p>

<p>“You saw the young man who came to this
room?”</p>

<p>“The brown-haired one? Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Nick pointed to the silent figure in the chair at
the table.</p>

<p>The boy stepped forward and peered into the
dead man’s face.</p>

<p>“Gee!” he cried, springing toward the door.
“Why didn’t you tell me he was dead? Did that
other feller kill him?”</p>

<p>“That is what we are trying to find out,” said
Nick. “Now, when this young man came up in
the elevator, did he say anything to you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, he asked me if I knew the party in forty-three.”</p>

<p>“And you?”</p>

<p>“I told him that I did not. I had seen him only
once.”</p>

<p>“Is that all he said?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“How did he act?”</p>

<p>“Queer, I thought. When he stepped out of
the cage he turned back again, as if he thought
of going back down with me. Once or twice he
clutched his left side, up there by the inside
pocket.”</p>

<p>“I wish he had gone down again!” cried Maynard,
starting from his chair. “He lost his life
by going on! Can nothing be done, Mr. Carter?
Is he past all hope of recovery?”</p>

<p>Nick dismissed the elevator boy and turned to
the agitated young man.</p>

<p>“Don’t give way to your emotions now,” he
said. “We have much to do if the murderer is
ever brought to justice and the diamonds recovered.”</p>

<p>“Never mind the diamonds,” said Maynard. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
wish I had never set eyes on them! First my
poor uncle, and now my best friend! The devil
is in the diamonds! I hope I shall never see them
again.”</p>

<p>“Are you strong enough to remain here while
I take a look at the body and the room? If not,
you would better sit in the office.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’ll remain here. Poor Henry! You
don’t know what it is to lose a chum like that.”</p>

<p>Nick approached the body and lifted the head
from the table.</p>

<p>There was no blood in sight.</p>

<p>But just over the heart was a faint stain. The
detective opened the shirt and saw a tiny puncture
in the breast. The dead man had been stabbed
with some slender weapon. The wound was exactly
over the heart.</p>

<p>Nick gazed long and thoughtfully at the still
figure. He did not understand how the wound
could have been made so exactly over the vital
spot. If Townsend had resisted, such a mode of
murder would have been impossible. Then a light
came to the wondering detective.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>He bent forward and laid his face close to that
of the dead man.</p>

<p>“I thought so!” he then muttered.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Maynard.</p>

<p>“A spray of chloroform was thrown into
Townsend’s face, and the wound was made while
he was dazed, if not quite unconscious.”</p>

<p>“But if the murderer had him under the influence
of the drug, why did he not permit the drug
to do the work? This stabbing seems brutal and
unnecessary.”</p>

<p>“I can’t understand that part of it myself,” said
Nick. “However, we shall know more of the
details before long.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a weapon was it?” asked Maynard.
“The cut is a tiny one.”</p>

<p>“It might have been made with a hatpin,” said
Nick.</p>

<p>“Men don’t carry hatpins about with them,”
said Maynard.</p>

<p>“This murder,” replied Nick, “was committed
by a woman.”</p>

<p>“A woman!” echoed Maynard.</p>

<p>“Exactly, by a woman disguised as a man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
That may be why the young man was dazed with
a spray of chloroform before the fatal blow was
struck. The woman was not strong or daring
enough to take the risk of determined resistance.”</p>

<p>“But how do you know that it was a woman
who was here? The clerk said nothing about
that.”</p>

<p>“The clerk was deceived. See here! This blue
ribbon comes from the front of a woman’s undervest.
In the haste of dressing in Townsend’s
clothes, the ribbon broke and she tossed it aside.
There are other things that tell me it was a
woman, sure enough.”</p>

<p>“Think of a woman doing a thing like this!”
cried Maynard.</p>

<p>“Horrible crimes have been committed by
women,” said Nick, laying the cast-off clothing of
the murderer on the table and drawing up a chair.</p>

<p>“There is nothing in the pockets,” he finally
said. “Not a blessed thing. Now for the tailor.
Ah!”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Maynard, as Nick gave a
start of surprise.</p>

<p>“The clothes,” he said, “were made in Paris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
by Mons. Dumond. Here is the mark of the
firm on the inner side of the collar. Careless
thing to leave that mark here. It tells a great
deal.”</p>

<p>“I see no name there,” said Maynard.</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said the detective, “but the
trade-mark of the firm is here. I have seen it before
under similar circumstances. Dumond
makes clothes for actors; and has also been nicknamed
the thieves’ tailor. In other words, he
makes duplicates, imitations, disguises, and all
sorts of trick garments. He is known by the better
class of rascals the world over.”</p>

<p>“Then we can easily learn the name of the person
who ordered this suit.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.
<br />
<small>THE HUSTLING REPORTER.</small></h2>


<p>Nick smiled at the simplicity of the young man.</p>

<p>“Dumond has a reputation for keeping his
mouth shut,” he said, “and that is the reason he
has built up such a profitable business. Go to him
to-morrow with this suit, trade-mark and all, and
he will swear that the trade-mark is a forgery,
and that he never saw the clothes before.”</p>

<p>“Do you think the woman came to America in
quest of these diamonds?” asked Maynard.</p>

<p>Nick did not reply immediately. He was examining
a comb and brush which lay upon a dresser
at the head of the bed.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he finally said, turning to Maynard
with the brush and comb in his hand, “the
woman could not resist the temptation to primp
before the mirror. And she left hairs in the
brush and the comb.”</p>

<p>Maynard took the brush into his hand.</p>

<p>“What do you see there?” asked Nick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not black hairs, certainly. Short red hairs.”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“But this person was dark,” insisted Maynard;
“at least so described by the clerk.”</p>

<p>“Also described by the clerk as a man,” said
Nick, with a smile.</p>

<p>“How do you know that these hairs were not
left here by some former occupant of the room?”
asked the young man.</p>

<p>“Because,” was the reply, “she combed her hair,
after removing her black wig, before she removed
her clothes. There were short red hairs on the
collar of the coat she wore.”</p>

<p>“A red-haired woman,” mused Maynard.</p>

<p>“Very slender and with black eyes,” added
Nick. “She couldn’t color her eyes, you know,
and the clerk said they were black. We may also
add a very nice white complexion.”</p>

<p>Nick went to the washstand in the corner of
the room and pointed to a black sediment on the
sides of the bowl. The piece of toilet soap which
lay on the marble top was also rimmed with black.
The interior of the bowl and the surface of the
soap were still moist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“There is where she washed off her face stain,”
said Nick. “So we have a slender, red-haired,
fair-complexioned woman, about five feet three,
according to the clothes, with very small feet and
hands.”</p>

<p>“How do you know about the feet and hands?”
asked the young man.</p>

<p>“The woman slopped water from the bowl as
she washed,” was the reply, “and it fell on the
carpet and over her shoes. See, the spot where
this foot stood is dry; the carpet is wet, and the
dry spot represents a very small shoe.”</p>

<p>“We started in with a dark-complexioned male
murderer,” said Maynard, “and now we have
come to a fair-faced woman with red hair, and
clothes made in Paris.”</p>

<p>“You asked me a moment ago,” said Nick, “if I
thought this woman came across the Atlantic in
quest of these diamonds, and I made no reply.
Now, I can tell you that it is possible that she
did, and that she did not come alone.”</p>

<p>“A conspiracy for robbery?”</p>

<p>“That is about the size of it, as it looks now.”</p>

<p>“Do you think this affair in any way connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
with the former larceny of the diamonds, when
they were followed from South Africa?”</p>

<p>“There is little doubt of it,” was the reply.
“Who was with you to-night besides the dead
man?”</p>

<p>“Why, I was at rehearsal, as I told you at first.
That is the way the diamonds came to be with
me. They were to be used in the play, you know.”</p>

<p>“And the members of the club knew that you
had them with you?”</p>

<p>“Of course. They admired them vastly.”</p>

<p>“And who did you talk with about them; especially,
I mean?”</p>

<p>“Julius Mantelle, I think.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?”</p>

<p>“A recent acquaintance from Paris and a member
of the club. During the rehearsal he made
an appointment with me.”</p>

<p>“Where were you going?”</p>

<p>“Why, I told you about that. To the African
fortune teller’s. We had a date for two o’clock,
and we waited at the café, Townsend and I, for
Julius to come.”</p>

<p>“He did not arrive until after Townsend left?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“No. He went home with one of the ladies.”</p>

<p>“Had you talked with Julius, as you call him,
about the African fortune teller before to-night?
You mean the fortune teller out on East Houston
Street?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he had long promised to secure a private
séance for Townsend and I, and to-night the
chance came.”</p>

<p>“What do you know of Julius Mantelle?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Is he in business?”</p>

<p>“He is just a globe trotter, I think.”</p>

<p>“Plenty of money?”</p>

<p>“I think so. He never borrows.”</p>

<p>“How long have you known him?”</p>

<p>“About three months.”</p>

<p>“He came from Paris to New York?”</p>

<p>“So I am informed. That must be the clerk
coming back, and there seems to be some one with
him. I wonder if he called the police?”</p>

<p>The next moment the door was thrust open, and
the clerk, accompanied by a youth of breezy manners,
swung into the room. Nick looked at them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
sternly, for he was not patient when disturbed at
his work.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” he asked.</p>

<p>The young man, who was red-headed, freckled-faced,
and the owner of a perennial smile, advanced
toward the detective.</p>

<p>“I am to blame for the intrusion,” he said. “I’m
a reporter, and want to know all about this murder
and the loss of the diamonds. Which is Mr.
Charles Maynard, and which is Mr. Nicholas
Carter, the famous detective? Ah! the coroner
has not been called as yet. Here is the body of
the murdered man. What luck! Now, if you will
stand aside, I’ll take a snapshot of it.”</p>

<p>The young man began arranging a camera
which he carried in his coat pocket. Nick took
him by the back of the neck and landed him outside
the door.</p>

<p>“Now, keep out of here,” he said. “And you,
too,” he added, turning to the clerk.</p>

<p>“Oh, you can’t stop the press,” shouted the reporter,
pounding on the door. “I’ve got the story
right here. And another one to boot. Young
girl mysteriously murdered half an hour ago in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
a tenement on East Houston Street. Beautiful
girl! I took her picture.”</p>

<p>Nick opened the door.</p>

<p>“Come in here and tell me about it,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, you have thawed out, have you?” said the
young man. “Well, I don’t know much about the
case. The girl had been out during the night, I
take it. Anyway, there was a row, and the girl
was stabbed. The people of the tenement declare
they had a row over diamonds, or something of
that sort. I’m going back there right now. Want
to come with me?”</p>

<p>“It may have some connection with this case,”
whispered Maynard to the detective. “Diamonds
in the case, you know.”</p>

<p>“I was just thinking of that,” said Nick, “but
I am not entirely satisfied that this young man is
just what he pretends to be.”</p>

<p>“I might go back with him and find out,” suggested
Maynard.</p>

<p>For a moment Nick made no reply.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.
<br />
<small>INTO THE TRAP.</small></h2>


<p>“No,” said the detective presently, “I think I’d
better go myself, though it may be a trap. Hold
these people here while I slip down to the phone.”</p>

<p>During the absence of the detective the red-headed
young man moved swiftly about the room.
To Maynard he seemed to be looking for something.
He hung constantly in the vicinity of the
chair upon which the murderer’s clothing had
been placed after the exchange of garments.
Once or twice he got down on the floor and examined
the carpet. Maynard thought this remarkable,
but said nothing.</p>

<p>When Nick returned from the phone booth and
the young man was still busy in his search of the
room, Maynard explained his actions to the detective,
who smiled and said not a word in reply.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve got to get a move on,” said the
young fellow, in a moment. “Are you chaps coming
with me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“We must wait for the coroner,” replied Nick.</p>

<p>And so they waited, while the young man
fumed up and down. Nick turned to the clerk
again, motioning him into the hall, where he followed.</p>

<p>“When Townsend entered the office,” he asked,
“how did you know that he was the one this Martin
Haynes had asked for?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Haynes gave me a description and a
name.”</p>

<p>This set Nick to thinking on new lines for a
moment. Then he said:</p>

<p>“While we are waiting for the coroner, we may
as well go to the office and inspect the signature.”</p>

<p>Leaving Maynard and the reporter in the room,
Nick and the clerk descended to the office. The
signature, when inspected through a powerful
glass, proved to be a very ordinary one, but Nick
made certain that it was written by a woman.</p>

<p>“How did that reporter get in here?” asked
Nick.</p>

<p>“I suspect that the elevator boy gave him a tip,”
was the reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Nick called the boy, who looked confused, and
neither admitted nor denied the accusation.</p>

<p>Presently a deputy coroner arrived, and Nick
accompanied him to room 43. While the reporter
was asking him impossible questions, Nick took
the clothing left by the murderer to the office, and
left it with the clerk, carefully wrapped.</p>

<p>“Give that to no one,” he said. “I will call for
the package in person.”</p>

<p>Then the reporter and Maynard came down
the elevator, and the former started off.</p>

<p>“I’m going,” he said. “Come along.”</p>

<p>“Shall I come?” whispered Maynard.</p>

<p>“It is a trap,” said Nick, “and you may as well
go home so as to be fit to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Why do you say it is a trap?”</p>

<p>“Because that chap is not a reporter. How do
I know? If he was a reporter he would have telephoned
in something for the first edition the minute
he saw the body, without waiting for anything
more. Besides, what has he learned about the
dead man or the circumstances of the murder?”</p>

<p>“But if it is a trap, why do you go?”</p>

<p>“Because, if it is a trap, it is set by the murderer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
or some of her confederates, and going with
this young man will place me in touch with the
gang.”</p>

<p>“But it is dangerous.”</p>

<p>“All my work is dangerous.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you take officers with you?”</p>

<p>“I shall not be alone,” replied Nick significantly,
and turned away with the red-headed
young fellow.</p>

<p>As the detective and his young companion
passed out of the square of light in front of the
hotel, Maynard, standing irresolute at the window,
saw two men who had been hidden in a
stairway across Broadway leave their shelter and
follow them. Alarmed at the occurrence, Maynard
stepped out into the street and passed on in
the direction taken by the detective, the reporter,
and their pursuers.</p>

<p>He saw them turn east, and then they were lost
to his sight. With a heavy heart the young millionaire
returned to the hotel. Policemen were
standing guard out in the hall.</p>

<p>There was a door connecting room 43 with 44.
Maynard secured the latter room and threw himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
on the bed. He lay for a long time listening
to the talk of the officers, but finally fell into an
uneasy slumber.</p>

<p>When he awoke again there was a bright light
in 43. His door was a trifle ajar, and he could
hear voices in the room where the dead man lay.
He arose and stepped toward the door. Then a
voice that he knew came to his ears. It was the
voice of a woman.</p>

<p>“I think we’ve settled Nicholas for good and
all,” she said. “That was a clever thought.”</p>

<p>Maynard started back in terror. What was
that woman doing there, in the room with his
murdered chum? Why should she desire to see
the detective come to harm? Maynard actually
pinched himself to see if he was not dreaming.
But what he heard was a reality, fast enough.
Had this woman whose voice he heard taken any
part in the murder? While the young man puzzled
over the matter, another voice reached his
ears:</p>

<p>“Yes, Nick will trouble us no more,” it said.
“He went up against the wrong bunch this time.”</p>

<p>This voice was as familiar to Maynard as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
other, only it was a man’s voice. He could not figure
it out. Why should these people be here, and
why was the room open at all? Had Nick Carter
come to harm? With this thought prominent in
his mind, Maynard moved toward the doorway.
In the half light of the room he stumbled over a
rocker and fell heavily to the floor. Before he
could get on his feet again he heard quick steps
rushing into the room, saw a blaze of light from
the doorway; saw, also, two faces that he knew,
rage and apprehension showing upon them. Then
he called out, saw an uplifted arm, heard a wrathful
voice, and a blow descended.</p>

<p>When the officers came to 43 in the early morning,
they found the door to 44 open. Entering,
they found Maynard lying on the floor with a
frightful wound in his head and a stab in the region
of the heart. Room 43 gave many evidences
of having been searched thoroughly. Even the
carpet had been loosened in places. The body of
Townsend, however, had been in no wise disturbed.
Maynard was conveyed to his hotel, and
the dead man taken to the residence of his parents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“If Maynard lives,” the doctor said, “it will be
a wonder. He was left for dead.”</p>

<p>The clue to the murderer which he had stumbled
on was of no avail at that time, for what he
knew might never aid in the detection of the criminals.
The wound on the head, the doctor said,
was liable to produce a lapse of memory which
would go further back than the night on which it
was received.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Nick Carter was satisfied that
Maynard had gone to his rooms from the hotel,
and would remain there until the next day. As
he walked down the street with the self-styled
reporter, the detective listened between steps for
a sound he hoped to hear not far away. No such
sound came to his ears. Presently he found himself
in Houston Street.</p>

<p>The house occupied by the African fortune
teller with whom Maynard and Townsend had
made an appointment was not far away. Nick
knew the place well, for, as much out of curiosity
as anything, he had called upon the woman when
she had first attracted the attention of the town,
and had made a close scrutiny of her apartments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
which were on the first floor of an old residence
not far from the East River.</p>

<p>There was a red light over the door, but the
building seemed still and the window shades were
closely drawn. The young man stopped directly
in front of the house.</p>

<p>“This is the place,” he said.</p>

<p>Again Nick listened for the expected footfalls,
but in vain. There was nothing for it but to go
in alone and trust to luck. He had summoned
Chick and Patsy from his home when he had
called the coroner, instructing them to hasten to
the hotel and trail him, wherever he went. Something
had possibly happened to disarrange the
plan.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.
<br />
<small>THE GREAT DIAMOND SYNDICATE.</small></h2>


<p>“Are you coming in?” asked the alleged reporter.
“The girl I told you of is in the rear
room on the second floor.”</p>

<p>Nick made a quick decision.</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” he said.</p>

<p>He knew that he was entering a trap, and that
his life would be in danger, but he had no thought
of turning back.</p>

<p>The young man rang the bell, and in a moment
the door was opened, showing the interior of a
plainly furnished hallway from which a flight of
stairs led to a floor above. The place was illuminated
only by the red hanging lamp which showed
through the transom over the street door; and the
general appearance was mysterious. Somehow
the atmosphere of the room carried out the impression
given by the light. The first impulse on
entering was to flee from some unseen peril.
There was a strong odor of musk about the place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
and this seemed to the vivid imagination to conceal
the presence of something uncanny.</p>

<p>As the two entered the hallway they were met
by a stalwart servant in the regulation dress coat
and white vest. There was something sinister in
the fellow’s face as he barred the way to the staircase.
He spoke in French.</p>

<p>“Why are you here?”</p>

<p>“This is an officer,” replied the young man.
“We have come to see the body of the girl who
was killed here not long ago.”</p>

<p>The servant pointed up the staircase, saying:</p>

<p>“We have nothing to conceal from the police.
First door to the left.”</p>

<p>The two started on up the stairs, the young
fellow in the lead. Nick was watchful and ready
with a revolver, which was hidden within easy
reach under his coat. He understood the peril of
the situation, but trusted to his usual good luck to
get him out of any complications that might arise.
He was now satisfied that the secret of Townsend’s
death lay in that house, and he was determined
to uncover it.</p>

<p>But the detective had no opportunity to use his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
weapon. The forces with which he was contending
were keener than he supposed. Halfway up
the staircase a spray of chloroform struck him
in the face, blinding him and sending him to the
floor in an unconscious condition. This was a
form of attack upon which he had not figured.</p>

<p>When he regained consciousness he was lying,
securely bound as to hands and feet, on a leather
couch in a room which looked like an ordinary
business office. There were two windows, evidently
facing a street, for the shades were drawn
over the panes and inside blinds still further shut
out the view. There were three doors to the room,
one from the hall, through which he concluded he
had been carried, a second connecting with what
must be a small front room over the lower hall,
and one connecting with a rear apartment. In
the matter of furniture, the room was supplied
with two curtain-top desks, two swivel chairs, and
the leather couch upon which the detective found
himself. A gas log blazed in a grate opposite the
hall door.</p>

<p>At first Nick’s head buzzed badly, but he soon
recovered. Then his eyes fell on the figure of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
man sitting at a desk in the front of the room.
The fellow was lean and muscular, with a large
head, remarkably flat on top, and keen black eyes.
As Nick looked him over, he swung around in
his chair.</p>

<p>“You are coming to, eh?” he said. “That dose
would have finished an ordinary man. How are
you feeling?”</p>

<p>“Never better,” replied Nick. “You seem to be
quite comfortable here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we are fairly well fixed here, though our
London office is more luxurious.”</p>

<p>Nick had no idea where he was. The man he
was talking with looked and acted like a business
man absorbed in his work. There was nothing
suspicious or terrifying about the apartment. In
fact, the leather thongs which bound him were
the only evidences that he was not in an ordinary
place of business.</p>

<p>“This is a new one on me,” said the detective
presently. “What became of the young fellow
who brought me here?”</p>

<p>“He has gone out to see about another matter,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
was the reply. “Remarkable man, that. You believed
him to be a reporter?”</p>

<p>“I certainly did not,” replied Nick. “I understood
that I was walking into a trap, but thought
I could trust to luck.”</p>

<p>“And you are still trusting to luck?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. I shall get out in some way.”</p>

<p>“You have no idea where you are?”</p>

<p>“On Houston Street, I presume,” replied Nick,
wondering if the men he had ordered on duty had
located the house he entered.</p>

<p>“Streets do not matter,” said the other. “It is
the place that counts. This looks all regular,
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>The fellow glanced about the room with evident
pride.</p>

<p>“It looks all right,” said Nick. “What is the
game?”</p>

<p>“It is the office of the Great Diamond Syndicate,”
was the reply, “or a branch office, rather,
for the main establishment is in London.”</p>

<p>“You have the Maynard diamonds here, I presume?”
asked Nick.</p>

<p>“They are not far away,” was the reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“The syndicate steals diamonds, eh?” asked
Nick.</p>

<p>“Acquires diamonds,” corrected the other.</p>

<p>“And plans a cowardly murder now and then?”
continued Nick.</p>

<p>“We do not consider the means,” was the reply.
“We look only to results. We are organized in
the regular way and pay very large dividends.
Men organize to secure lands and other things
without paying for them. Why shouldn’t we organize
to acquire diamonds? We don’t aim to
commit violence. In fact, we are a very respectable
institution. You will find us rated in the commercial
agencies.”</p>

<p>“The fellow intends to murder me,” thought
Nick, “else he would not be so free with the affairs
of the concern.”</p>

<p>“We have offices and agents in all the large cities,”
continued the fellow, “and are doing a fine
business. Whenever a rare collection of gems
is made, we list it. From that time we are on the
lookout to acquire it. Let me give you an illustration
of our methods. The diamonds which you
call the Maynard diamonds were collected in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
South Africa. The collection was reported at our
London office. We sent two men out to Cape
Town to get them, but they did not succeed.</p>

<p>“The diamonds were sold to a man who shipped
them to this country. Our men followed on the
same ship, and reported to our agent here. They
got them in New York, but lost them again. One
of these men was killed, the other is serving time,
as you know. Then this young man Maynard got
the diamonds back through your efforts. He has
been followed by two of our best men for a year,
so you see that the collection has cost us quite a
tidy sum of money.”</p>

<p>“Quite enterprising, I’m sure,” said Nick.
“How many people have you put out of the way
in your quest for the Maynard diamonds?”</p>

<p>“I don’t confess to any crime,” was the reply.
“I think, on the whole, that we are very considerate
in our methods. Why, we acquire plenty of
collections without wasting a drop of blood.
There was the Harvard collection, two millions;
the Gould lot, one million; the Montreville collection,
half a million; the Burns lot, one million.
Not a drop of blood shed, no one arrested, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
diamonds shipped away. You can see for yourself
that we are doing the best we can with a peculiar
business. We have our agents in all grades
of society.”</p>

<p>“Even in dramatic clubs,” said Nick.</p>

<p>“Even in dramatic clubs,” repeated the other,
with a smile. “We really enjoyed the chase after
the Maynard diamonds.”</p>

<p>“You seem to be enjoying the present situation,”
said Nick. “How long are you to keep me
in this uncomfortable position?”</p>

<p>“Why, the fact is,” said the other, “that we
are waiting for a report from a man who was sent
to your residence two hours ago. You see, you
have a collection of gems which is listed at half a
million in the office of the Great Diamond Syndicate
in London. You have put us to so much trouble
and expense that we thought best to acquire
this collection, and a man has gone up after it.
He is to search the steel vault off your sleeping
room and all available parts of the house. If he
can do so, he will accomplish his work without
bloodshed, but you have trained your people to resist
coercion, and there may be a fight. I sincerely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
hope that no member of your family will be injured.</p>

<p>“We are doing this thing for two reasons,” continued
the other. “In the first place, you were sentenced
to death in London not long ago, and cannot
long enjoy the possession of the diamonds. In
the second place, we thought best to demonstrate
to you, previous to your death, that you detectives
are, on the whole, rather cheap people. You go
about with your picklock and your electric torch,
and think you are the whole thing. Now you see
how hopeless you are in the hands of a syndicate
of brainy and determined men.”</p>

<p>“And if the man at my house does not find the
diamonds?” asked Nick dryly.</p>

<p>“Then you will be required to write an order
for their delivery to this place.”</p>

<p>Nick shut his teeth with a snap.</p>

<p>“You won’t, eh?” said the other. “Pardon me,
but I think you will. We have means of persuasion
here. What do you think of our methods by
this time?”</p>

<p>“Of course you have planned my death?” asked
Nick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course,” was the reply. “Do you think I
would talk so freely with a man who was to be
permitted to live?”</p>

<p>“Then, if I am to die, anyway, why should I
comply with your wishes in the matter of the diamonds?”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.
<br />
<small>A DESPERATE GAME.</small></h2>


<p>A sinister smile flashed over the white face of
the man at the desk.</p>

<p>“There are many methods of executing the orders
of the Great Diamond Syndicate,” he said,
“and there are forms of death calculated to break
the most obstinate will. Besides, the safety of
your beloved Chick ought to count for something
with you.”</p>

<p>The detective strained at his bonds and ground
his teeth in impotent rage.</p>

<p>“I’d like to have half an hour with you with
bare knuckles,” he said, as the man at the desk
gazed upon him in triumph. “I think I could
teach you a few points in humanity. Let me tell
you now that the American head of the Great
Diamond Syndicate is not equal to his job. In
short, is a very cheap fool.”</p>

<p>“I am not a passionate person,” said the other.
“Proceed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you were fit for the position,” continued
Nick, “you would never have permitted me to regain
consciousness.”</p>

<p>“We are looking to you for help in securing
your diamonds,” was the cool reply.</p>

<p>“Then, having made this mistake, you should
never have confided the secrets of your syndicate
to me.”</p>

<p>“We decided to bring you down a peg or two
before your death, to show you how little you
were really capable of when pitted against men of
ability and courage.”</p>

<p>“To humiliate me, in fact?”</p>

<p>“To punish you.”</p>

<p>“What do you suppose I’ll do to your syndicate
when I get out of here?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“You’ll never get out,” was the reply. “You
are as good as dead now.”</p>

<p>Nick smiled and turned his face to the wall. He
was listening intently for some indication of the
presence of his assistants. He had no idea how
they would get to him, but he was satisfied that
get to him they would.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently there came a ring at the door. Nick
knew by the sound that he was on the second floor
of the house. He had little doubt that he was still
in the house occupied wholly or in part by the
African fortune teller. He was now convinced
that the woman was a confederate of the diamond
thieves.</p>

<p>Nick listened with his heart beating wildly as
he heard the front door opened. He was naturally
anxious about the safety of his assistants
and Joseph. He had not the least doubt that the
thieves had actually planned a robbery at his
house. As fate would have it, there was no one
in the house save Joseph, if Chick and Patsy had
obeyed his telephone call. The thieves might
really secure his diamonds, but that was not the
chief cause of his anxiety.</p>

<p>“There will be a long score to settle when I get
out of this,” he thought.</p>

<p>Presently the man arose from the desk and approached
the door leading into the hall. There
were now loud voices out there, and Nick was
listening with all his senses alert. The man
opened the door a trifle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is coming off out there?” he demanded,
in French.</p>

<p>“This fool servant won’t let me into the house,”
came a voice which sounded remarkably like that
of the alleged reporter who had guided Nick to
the place. It was like the young fellow’s voice,
and yet it was not. There was a note in it which
Nick recognized. He was satisfied that it was
Chick playing a desperate game.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Maurice?” asked the man,
standing in the doorway.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t make correct replies,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“I do, too! He’s a fool!”</p>

<p>“Bring him up here and keep a strong hold on
him,” commanded the chief of the diamond
thieves.</p>

<p>“I’ll go up there, all right,” was the reply, “but
if he touches me, I’ll knock his head off. I ought
to know all about this den, if I have fuddled my
head a bit with drink, and I have been with you
longer than he has.”</p>

<p>Nick saw the chief step back to his desk and
grasp a revolver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is a counterfeit,” he said, looking toward
Nick with a smile. “It is probably one of your
men trying to break into the game. We’ll let him
up and see what he looks like; then we’ll settle
him for good.”</p>

<p>As the chief stepped back to the door, Nick
gave a sharp call of warning, which he knew that
Chick would understand. The chief turned angrily
in his direction for just an instant. In that
instant there was a quick, heavy blow below, and
a fall. Then a cool breath of air from the street
swept through the hall and up the stairs to the
room where Nick lay.</p>

<p>The chief of the diamond thieves turned back
into the room. There was a look of brutal rage
on his face.</p>

<p>“You were right,” he said. “I presumed too
much on the competence of our guards. You
know too much to be allowed to leave this place
alive.”</p>

<p>As he leveled his revolver at the helpless detective
there came a rush on the outer staircase,
and he paused, as if uncertain whether it would
not be better to turn his weapon on the intruders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>At that critical moment there came a sharp call
for help, seemingly from the rear room, and he
bounded in that direction.</p>

<p>“Help! I am being strangled.”</p>

<p>The voice appeared to be that of a woman.</p>

<p>The would-be murderer, when he reached the
room whence the cry had seemed to proceed,
found it entirely unoccupied. With a muttered
oath he sprang back to the helpless detective on
the couch, and again lifted his weapon.</p>

<p>He was too late to accomplish the murder of
his prisoner. Chick, disguised as the young man
who had played the part of the reporter, swept
into the room and struck down the revolver. The
bullet buried itself in the carpet. Behind Chick
came Patsy and Danny, Nick’s chauffeur, who
had entered the lower hall when Chick had opened
the door, after putting the guard out with a blow.</p>

<p>The would-be murderer disappeared in the rear
room before Chick could lay hands on him, and
closed the door in the faces of his pursuers. They
had the barrier open in a trice, but the chief of the
diamond thieves had disappeared. An open door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
showing a private staircase leading to the basement
revealed the manner of his flight.</p>

<p>While the other two hastened down the staircase
in hot pursuit, Chick turned back to his chief.</p>

<p>“Rather close call that,” he said. “It is a wonder
the fellow did not shoot before we could get
into the room.”</p>

<p>“His attention was attracted elsewhere,” said
Nick, with a smile, as Chick released him from
his bonds.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand,” said the assistant. “I
surely thought it was all off with you. What happened?”</p>

<p>“There was a call for help from the back
room,” said Nick, with a grin.</p>

<p>“I see,” said Chick. “Some of your ventriloquism.
Well, it saved your life, all right. What
next?”</p>

<p>In a few words he informed Chick of the situation.</p>

<p>“I must get home at once,” he said.</p>

<p>Just then Patsy and Danny made their appearance.</p>

<p>“It’s no use,” Patsy said. “The house is empty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
I can’t understand how they got away so handily.”</p>

<p>“Then the game is about played out so far as
this place is concerned,” said Nick, “and we may
as well take our departure for the present.”</p>

<p>He made a quick inspection of the two desks,
gathered the few papers they held into a package,
and turned to the door.</p>

<p>“Call the police,” he said to Chick, “and leave
them in charge of the building. We may have
further use for some of the traps here. Wait!
Here is a phone.”</p>

<p>He called his private number and waited impatiently.
At length the voice of Joseph came over
the wire.</p>

<p>“Have you had visitors to-night?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“We certainly have,” came the reply, with a
tinge of triumph in the tones.</p>

<p>“Did they get into the house?” asked Nick anxiously.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” was the reply. “I made short work
of the thieves. One was wounded and taken to
the hospital, and the others escaped.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>After some further conversation Nick hung up
the receiver.</p>

<p>“This has been a bad night for the Great Diamond
Syndicate,” he said.</p>

<p>“That is a new one on me,” said Chick, and in
a few words Nick explained the interview with
the chief of the syndicate.</p>

<p>“Do you think he was telling the truth?” asked
the assistant.</p>

<p>“He was certainly correct about the attempt to
rob my house,” replied Nick.</p>

<p>“But it does not seem possible that such a syndicate
as he told of could exist in this age of the
world.”</p>

<p>“There are strange things connected with criminal
life,” said the detective. “I can see how such
an organization as he described could be made to
pay large dividends, and there is no knowing what
thieves will do. London is headquarters for all
manner of strange syndicates. Nothing is impossible
over there.”</p>

<p>“It sounds like romance,” said Chick.</p>

<p>“Anyway,” continued Nick, “we can soon learn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the truth or falsity of the fellow’s statements. He
will give himself away before long, for he is vain
and proud of his skill in criminal work. Just
imagine his telling me all about his syndicate!”</p>

<p>“He only wanted to show you what could be
done in spite of the officers of the law,” said
Chick. “Besides, he sought to make you look like
thirty cents, as the boys on the Bowery say.”</p>

<p>“They are a bold lot,” said Nick. “Think of
their sending that young man to the hotel to bring
me here! However, their scheme worked to our
advantage rather than to their own. By the way,
where did you get that make-up?”</p>

<p>“I watched the fellow at the Wisconsin, and
saw you go off with him,” was the reply. “I saw
what you were working, and followed on as you
directed. When you came in here, I ducked away
and got this suit. Pretty near correct, eh?”</p>

<p>“It is about the thing,” replied Nick. “Listen!”</p>

<p>There was an alarm of fire in the street, and
then fire apparatus stopped in front of the building.
Chick opened the door to the hall and looked
out. The whole place was in flames. The detectives
darted toward the private staircase, seeking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
escape by way of the basement, but were there
met by a column of flame.</p>

<p>Nick threw open the windows, and fire ladders
soon made their appearance. It was clear that the
lower part of the structure was little better than
a furnace.</p>

<p>“They hardly succeeded in burning us alive,”
said Chick, as the four men stood on the pavement
below. “That was a fool trick, it seems
to me.”</p>

<p>“The idea,” said Nick, “was undoubtedly to
destroy the papers and identifying records of the
Great Diamond Syndicate. In this they only partially
succeeded, for I have quite a mess of documents
in my pocket. The house, however, seems
to be doomed to destruction.”</p>

<p>This was indeed the fact, for the building
burned to the ground. It was afterward discovered
that the basement had been filled with combustible
material, for use in just such an emergency.
It was clear to the detectives that the
Great Diamond Syndicate took due care of its
secrets. It is true that the chief, believing Nick
Carter to be as good as dead, had talked of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
syndicate to him, but he had done this principally
through vanity, and with the purpose of showing
how the keenest detectives of the day had been
outwitted by the superior wisdom and courage of
the mighty syndicate.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.
<br />
<small>MORE TROUBLE.</small></h2>


<p>As Nick thought over, word for word, the talk
of the diamond thief, he could not see that his
communications had much injured the syndicate.
He had informed the detective that there was
such a syndicate, and that was about all. However,
this was something to start with, especially
as the papers of the syndicate had been captured.
Indeed, Nick had already suspected the presence
of a great conspiracy in the matter of the robbery.
He had understood that it was not the
work of one man. The discovery that the murder
had been committed by a woman who wore clothing
made in Paris had started this train of
thought. His experiences at the house on Houston
Street, independent of the admission of the
chief thief, had confirmed his earlier notions.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Nick, “they have done the best
thing they could under the circumstances. This
blaze scatters the American branch of the Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Diamond Syndicate. Only for the papers I have
in my possession, the very name might be something
in the nature of a dream, for all the talk of
the chief thief.”</p>

<p>“Have you looked at the papers?” asked Chick.</p>

<p>“Just enough to discover that they really deal
with the doings of some powerful syndicate,” was
the reply. “Unless I am very much mistaken, we
shall get no names or incriminating facts from
them.”</p>

<p>“What’s the next move?” asked Chick.</p>

<p>“I shall go to the office until morning,” was the
reply. “I have some work to do there, and I can
get a short sleep on the couch.”</p>

<p>“It is almost morning now.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll meet at the office at eight o’clock,”
said Nick.</p>

<p>And at eight o’clock Nick, Chick, and Patsy sat
in the private room of the downtown office which
Nick had lately taken with the object of having
two headquarters from which to work.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Nick, turning to his first assistant,
“the chief thief mentioned last night by name
four diamond collections which have been stolen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
by the syndicate. I remember the main features
of the crimes, but of course I know nothing of the
details. What I want you to do is to take up
these cases and learn all about them. It may be
that the hands of the syndicate’s agents may show
in some of the deals. It may be that you can trace
the finger marks of one person through all the
robberies. Locate all the persons, high and low,
who might have taken the diamonds in each case.”</p>

<p>Chick made a hasty note on his private memorandum,
and said:</p>

<p>“Have you been to the Wisconsin this morning?”</p>

<p>“I have not been out of the office,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>“You will find something doing up there,” said
Chick.</p>

<p>“Wait,” said Nick, “let me get the story first
hand. You turn this assignment over to Patsy
and come with me to the Wisconsin.”</p>

<p>The detectives were not long in getting to the
hotel. There Nick learned of the occurrences of
the night.</p>

<p>“Have you heard from Maynard this morning?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
he asked of the night clerk, who, pale and
distressed, seemingly because of what had taken
place, lingered about the corridors instead of going
to his room.</p>

<p>“He is no worse,” was the reply. “I have just
come from there. It seems that he recognized
the people who struck him down.”</p>

<p>“Does he mention names?”</p>

<p>“No; he only says: ‘I know you both. Don’t
strike me.’ Strange thing all along.”</p>

<p>“How did the assailants get into the room?”
asked Nick.</p>

<p>“That’s what puzzles me,” was the reply. “I
certainly did not let them in.”</p>

<p>“Where is the elevator boy who was on watch
last night?”</p>

<p>“He is asleep upstairs. I told him not to leave
the building.”</p>

<p>“Bring him down.”</p>

<p>But the elevator boy was not upstairs. He was
not in the hotel at all.</p>

<p>“I am sorry for this,” said the clerk, “because I
wanted to clear myself in another matter.”</p>

<p>Nick scented more trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the clerk, evidently very much
frightened, “you gave me a bundle last night, and
asked me to keep it until you personally came for
it. Did you get it during the night?”</p>

<p>Nick saw what the new trouble was, and was
angry, but gave no evidence of the fact.</p>

<p>“I did not,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Well, the boy gave the bundle out last night.
He stated that you called for it.”</p>

<p>“At what time was it given out?”</p>

<p>“Quite early in the morning.”</p>

<p>“After the assault on Maynard?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; so he said.”</p>

<p>“Where were you?”</p>

<p>“I dozed off and left the boy in charge.”</p>

<p>“Is it usual to leave a boy on watch?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, only——”</p>

<p>“Never mind that now. What did the boy say
about it?”</p>

<p>“Just said you came after the package.”</p>

<p>Nick was not satisfied that the clerk was telling
the truth. He was very much annoyed at the loss
of the clothes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“I did not think you had been here,” said the
clerk, “and was angry with the boy.”</p>

<p>“And you scolded him, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he will return?”</p>

<p>“I do not, sir.”</p>

<p>Nick was provoked enough to lock the clerk up,
but he realized that, even if he was in partnership
with the thieves, better results could be obtained
by leaving him at liberty.</p>

<p>“Do you think he belongs to the Great Diamond
Syndicate?” asked Chick, as the two walked away.</p>

<p>“It is all a guess,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“I have an idea that he got that alleged reporter
into the house last night,” said the assistant.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.
<br />
<small>MORE SURPRISES.</small></h2>


<p>“The alleged reporter,” said Nick, “was probably
waiting about the house. He knew that a
murder had been committed, and his orders probably
were to get a line on what was being done.
He might have bribed the clerk or the boy; probably
he did.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is the story,” said Chick. “The syndicate
did not expect that a murder would be necessary,
and those in charge of the case were
alarmed. They doubtless had a notion that they
would be all right if they could only get you out
of the way.”</p>

<p>“What about this Mantelle?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“Do you think he is in the game?”</p>

<p>“He made the appointment which kept Maynard
downtown with his diamonds,” was the reply,
“and he made it only when he knew that the
diamonds were in sight.”</p>

<p>“But he was not at the café until after Townsend
left,” said the assistant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>“Anyway, we’ll look him up,” said Nick.</p>

<p>“There is one thing certain,” said Chick, “and
that is, the case will be won if Maynard ever recovers
so as to be able to give the names of the
people he saw in room forty-four before he was
struck down.”</p>

<p>“We can’t afford to wait for that,” said Nick.
“The robbers and the murderer must be caught
at once, if at all.”</p>

<p>“And the diamonds?”</p>

<p>“I am no longer interested in the diamonds.”</p>

<p>This conversation had taken place, in low tones,
in the hallway near to the door of room 43. The
hall was deserted except for a chambermaid
loitering at the farther end. It was too early for
the guests to be astir.</p>

<p>Nick now unlocked the door to room 43, and
stepped inside.</p>

<p>As he did so, a lady, who occupied room 42, directly
across the hallway, opened her door, and
called to the maid.</p>

<p>She handed her a piece of silver as she came
up to where she stood, leaning out into the corridor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“Kindly go to the office and ask for mail for
Mrs. Morton,” she said.</p>

<p>The maid hastened away.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Morton stepped across the hall, and
stood before the door of room 43.</p>

<p>Nick had not yet left the door, but was standing
close to it on the inside. As the woman approached,
he listened for a moment, and then
opened the door.</p>

<p>The woman started back in dismay.</p>

<p>“Something you want?” asked Nick, with a
smile.</p>

<p>The woman, who was young and far from ill-looking,
blushed prettily.</p>

<p>“I’m ashamed of myself,” she said, “but I really
wanted to know what was going on in the murder
case, and so I listened. I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter,” replied Nick.</p>

<p>The woman sought her room, and Nick turned
back to his assistant.</p>

<p>“There is a clever crook,” he said.</p>

<p>“I wonder how she got here so soon?” remarked
Chick.</p>

<p>“You might go down and talk with the clerk,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
said Nick. “I’ll wager that she came here after
the assault on Maynard.”</p>

<p>While Nick made a second and more searching
examination of the room, Chick talked with the
night clerk, who still insisted on hanging about
the place.</p>

<p>“The woman came here from the Grand Central
Station in a carriage at seven-thirty,” said
the clerk. “She registered from Chicago, as you
see. No, there was no mail for her when the
maid called. What other errand did she give the
maid?”</p>

<p>“None whatever,” replied the assistant. “At
least none that we heard.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the clerk, “after making the inquiry
at the desk, the maid went out to the café
next to the reading room and talked with one of
the waiters.”</p>

<p>“You’ll not lose by giving out that information,”
said Chick.</p>

<p>Before the astonished clerk could make reply,
Chick was upstairs in the room Nick was searching.</p>

<p>“We are in a storm centre of the Great Diamond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Syndicate,” said Nick, when informed of
the acts of the maid. “This is a fine place to fish
for clues.”</p>

<p>“But how can the maid be in the employ of the
syndicate?” asked Chick. “Up to this time the
thieves have had no use for any one in this
house.”</p>

<p>“We’ll pass on that when the time comes,” said
Nick. “See what I found in this room.”</p>

<p>The detectives were standing in room 44.</p>

<p>“Red hair,” said Chick.</p>

<p>“Look at it with this glass.”</p>

<p>Chick did so.</p>

<p>“What do you find?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“Bleached,” was the short reply.</p>

<p>“Exactly!”</p>

<p>Nick took more red hairs from his pocketbook.</p>

<p>“I find,” he said, “that these are from a wig.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get those?”</p>

<p>“In room forty-three, last night. They were in
the brush and on the collar of the coat the murderer
wore.”</p>

<p>“And these hairs were found in this room?”</p>

<p>“There on the carpet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“And that means——”</p>

<p>“That the woman who committed the murder
came back here and tried to find out what was going
on. She found the room deserted, and entered.”</p>

<p>“There were two of them,” said Chick, pointing
to a lock of black curly hair on the floor, “and
one was a man, and Maynard grappled with him.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said Nick, “and some one let her
in, or let them in, rather.”</p>

<p>“And that some one knew that Maynard was
being murdered!”</p>

<p>“It’s a puzzle,” replied Nick. “I can’t for the
life of me see how the Great Diamond Syndicate
got into action here so quickly.”</p>

<p>“Money,” said Chick.</p>

<p>“I guess the chief thief didn’t exaggerate much
when he told me of the efficiency of his gang,”
said Nick.</p>

<p>The detective made a little package of the articles
he wished to take with him, and the two
descended to the office floor. The night clerk was
nowhere in sight. The day clerk was all attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“A strange thing has just happened,” he said.
“Our night elevator boy was badly injured near
here by the falling of a heavy jar from a high
window. He had been out on some errand, it
seems, and was returning.”</p>

<p>“Do you know when he left the hotel?” asked
Nick.</p>

<p>“Before I came on watch.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he was returning to the hotel?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that. He might not have
been.”</p>

<p>“Where was the boy taken?”</p>

<p>“To a hospital not far from the scene of the
accident,” was the reply.</p>

<p>The detectives hurried to the place where the
boy had been injured, and learned from the officer
on the beat the name of the institution to which
the boy had been taken.</p>

<p>In a short time Nick and Chick stood in a private
room of the establishment, making an examination
of the clothing worn by the boy, who
had not yet recovered consciousness.</p>

<p>For a time they searched in vain.</p>

<p>Then, at the front of the coat, appeared a narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
slit. In this was a folded paper bearing an
address, and the one word:</p>

<p>“Scatter!”</p>

<p>It seemed impossible to ascertain where the boy
had put in his time between the hour of leaving
the hotel and the hour of his disaster.</p>

<p>The address was that of a cheap lodging house
off the Bowery, but little could be learned there.</p>

<p>The tough clerk said that the boy had talked
with one or two lodgers, and gone away.</p>

<p>“A warning from the syndicate,” said Chick.
“They are up to date in their methods, it appears.”</p>

<p>There was silence between the two as they
walked back to the house from which the jar had
fallen.</p>

<p>“It was intended murder,” said Chick. “Just a
cold-blooded crime.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“The syndicate had bribed him and used him,
and were afraid he would not keep his tongue
between his teeth,” said Chick.</p>

<p>“Don’t jump at conclusions,” said Nick. “Accidents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
of this sort are not uncommon in New
York.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to the room from which the
jar fell?” asked the assistant.</p>

<p>“Right now,” was the reply. “We may be able
to get some sort of information from the people
of the building.”</p>

<p>“The Great Diamond Syndicate may have gotten
ahead of us,” said Chick. “Say, but that must
be a hot concern. They burn houses and try to
knock out whoever gets in their way. I wonder
if anything will eventually happen to that smart
chambermaid?”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.
<br />
<small>BY THE HAND OF A WOMAN.</small></h2>


<p>The detectives approached the building from
the opposite side of the street, keeping their eyes
on the third-story windows. The officer saw them,
and approached.</p>

<p>“I thought you’d come back,” he said. “It’s a
case worth looking up. I could get no satisfaction
up there. Had to return to my beat too
quick.”</p>

<p>“Did you see the jar fall?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“I did not,” was the reply, “but a woman who
was passing said it was thrown from the second
window on the right of the entrance, third floor.
She said she saw a head and an arm out of the
window as the jar fell.”</p>

<p>“What do they say up there?”</p>

<p>“That the room is not occupied.”</p>

<p>“What sort of folks are in that building?”</p>

<p>The policeman shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Tough,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, we are going up,” said Nick.</p>

<p>“I’ll wait about here,” said the officer, who
knew Nick and his assistant quite well. “Let me
know if anything happens.”</p>

<p>The two passed on up the stairs. They had,
however, been seen talking with the policeman. As
they reached the third floor, a rough voice
asked:</p>

<p>“What do you fellows want up here? You’d
better be making yourself scarce if you want to
keep your shape.”</p>

<p>The speaker was meanly dressed and generally
foul in appearance.</p>

<p>“I take it,” said Nick coolly, “that you are the
janitor.”</p>

<p>“What is it to you who I am?” demanded the
other. “Get out!”</p>

<p>Nick turned to his assistant.</p>

<p>“Call the policeman,” he said. “We’ll cool this
chap off in jail.”</p>

<p>“What have I done?” whined the janitor, seeing
that he had made a mistake.</p>

<p>“You might have thrown that jar down on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
boy, for all I know,” said Nick, with a wink at
Chick.</p>

<p>“What would I do such a thing for?” asked the
frightened janitor.</p>

<p>“For money,” replied the detective.</p>

<p>“Was it a murder?” asked the janitor, trembling.</p>

<p>“It looks like it might be before long.”</p>

<p>“Then the woman did it!” said the janitor.</p>

<p>“The woman?” repeated Nick. “What
woman?”</p>

<p>“Why,” was the reply, “the woman who rented
the room yesterday, and who went off just a little
while ago.”</p>

<p>“Just after the boy was killed?”</p>

<p>“Yes, not five minutes after.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a woman was it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t notice her particularly. One of
the sort that live here, I take it,” answered the
janitor.</p>

<p>“Young or old?”</p>

<p>“Middle-aged, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Did you rent the room to her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yesterday afternoon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>“What did she say about her occupation?”</p>

<p>“I asked no questions, sir. It is not always best
to do so.”</p>

<p>“Well, give us a look at the room.”</p>

<p>The place was small, and cheap, and dirty. In
the way of furniture it contained only a flat bed,
a spotted washstand, a chair, and an old dresser.
The detectives sent the janitor away, much to his
disappointment, and made a careful study of the
place.</p>

<p>“Here’s more red hair,” said Chick. “I wonder
if this is bleached?”</p>

<p>Examination showed that it was. Nick took
several articles from the chest and the top of the
dresser and carried them away with him.</p>

<p>“If the room was hired for the purpose of getting
rid of the boy,” said Chick, as the detectives
walked away, “why should it have been taken
yesterday? The boy was not in the game at that
time.”</p>

<p>“He was sent along that street because the window
was there with a murderous heart behind it.
The room was not hired because there was a plot
against the boy at that time. Presently we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
doubtless know why it was engaged, and who the
tenant was.”</p>

<p>“The whole case is a wonder,” said Chick. “I
confess that I don’t know what to make of it.
And it seems to me that we are not progressing
very rapidly.”</p>

<p>There was an inscrutable smile on the face of
the detective as he asked:</p>

<p>“What’s your notion of getting on with a
case?”</p>

<p>“Why, getting a clue to work on.”</p>

<p>“You don’t see one here?”</p>

<p>“Why, there’s a woman with bleached hair, and
a young man who calls himself a reporter, and
the chief of the Great Diamond Syndicate, and all
that, but we don’t know where to look for them.”</p>

<p>“There are two women with red hair,” said
Nick, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Two?”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“Then the woman who killed Townsend did not
occupy that room back there?”</p>

<p>“I think not.”</p>

<p>“Hair is different, eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s the idea.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s the chief of the syndicate. We
know he exists, but how are we to get to him?”</p>

<p>“They will all come in a bunch, like sheep,” said
Nick, “and the Great Diamond Syndicate will be
wiped off the continent.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got me guessing,” said Chick.</p>

<p>At noon the two detectives found themselves at
Maynard’s bedside.</p>

<p>He was unconscious, and talking wildly.</p>

<p>“Has he mentioned any names?” asked Nick of
the nurse.</p>

<p>“Not a single one.”</p>

<p>Then Nick turned to the doctor.</p>

<p>“Will he live?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I think so. He is young and strong, and may
recover, but he may have to learn his alphabet
again.”</p>

<p>“That is another trade-mark of the Great Diamond
Syndicate,” mused Nick. “Hartley, who
was one of their American agents, advocated
beating people on the head until they came from
the hospital mere imbeciles.”</p>

<p>Things looked suspiciously favorable to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
syndicate at that time. As Chick had stated
there was no clue to the whereabouts of the persons
wanted. Maynard was unconscious and the
elevator boy was in the same condition.</p>

<p>On leaving the sick room, Nick hastened to the
Townsend residence.</p>

<p>It was a sad-faced family he met there, and for
a time he delayed the important questions he had
come to ask. It seemed like making little of their
sorrow to trouble his parents with matters of the
law at that time. Finally he called the father
aside.</p>

<p>“You understand how difficult it is for me to
break in on you at this time,” he said, “but there
are questions which ought to be asked now.”</p>

<p>“I will do my best to answer them,” said the
father.</p>

<p>“You have heard your son speak of one Julius
Mantelle?”</p>

<p>“Occasionally.”</p>

<p>“Do you know where the fellow lives?”</p>

<p>“At the Hotel Cumberland, I think.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever met this man Julius.”</p>

<p>“Once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“Describe him, please.”</p>

<p>“Very dark, with broad nostrils, like a negro,
thick lips, black curly hair. He speaks English
with a slight French accent. I didn’t like the
looks of the man.”</p>

<p>“What about his eyes?”</p>

<p>“Like a snake’s.”</p>

<p>“Did you know that your son had an appointment
with him last night?”</p>

<p>“I did not.”</p>

<p>“Or with any one?”</p>

<p>“Not that I knew of. Is this man Mantelle suspected?”</p>

<p>“Well, he was about the café where your son
and Maynard took supper after the rehearsal. I
desire to locate him. Do you know where this rehearsal
was held?”</p>

<p>The detective was given a number of West
Fourteenth Street.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.
<br />
<small>MANTELLE AT BAY.</small></h2>


<p>“It strikes me,” said Chick, as the detectives
left the Townsend home, “that the Great Diamond
Syndicate is giving us the fight of our
lives.”</p>

<p>“It appears to be all that the chief declared it
to be,” said Nick, “a powerful organization, officered
by cunning scoundrels.”</p>

<p>“I think this man Mantelle knows something
about the syndicate.”</p>

<p>“We have no proof, yet I have been thinking
that same thing,” replied Nick, “and that is why
I went to the Townsend home, to see if it were
possible to get a line on the fellow. I did not succeed
very well, but I have another plan in my
mind.”</p>

<p>“Hunt him up and work the third degree?”
asked Chick.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” replied the chief. “If I can get up
an argument with him, or place him under accusation,
I can form an estimate that will guide me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>“There might be a little physical exertion connected
with an interview in which he was accused
of complicity in the murder,” said Chick, “and
that would help some. I am feeling in the need
of a thumping.”</p>

<p>“That may come soon enough,” replied Nick.</p>

<p>“It might be a good idea to watch the room in
the tenement,” said Chick. “There may be a reason
why the woman should go back there.”</p>

<p>“If she does, it will be in the nighttime,” was
the reply. “We will talk that over later. At this
time we’ll see if we can locate this man Mantelle.
No one appears to know much about the fellow.”</p>

<p>“He may be at the Cumberland,” said Chick.</p>

<p>Mantelle was not at his hotel when the detectives
called there, and so they went to the Bowery
café, whence Townsend had gone to his death.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Nick, as they approached the
place, “if we find him and there are others present,
you observe them while I am sizing up Mantelle.
And I may accuse him of all sort of things,
so be on your guard.”</p>

<p>The clerk informed Nick that Mantelle was at
breakfast with a friend in a rear room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you certain he has company?” asked
Nick. “You see, he had an appointment with me
at this hour—an important appointment. It is
possible that the other fellow is the man we both
expected to meet here. What sort of a looking
chap is he?”</p>

<p>“It is a woman,” said the man at the desk, “and
he asked particularly that they should not be disturbed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll see me,” said Nick, with a swagger
affected by precinct detectives.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to get in there the best way you
can, then,” said the clerk. “I am not going to
have you shown in.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” said Nick.</p>

<p>The clerk gave the detectives the number of
the room, and they opened the door and entered
without even the formality of knocking. Mantelle
sprang to his feet, rage showing in his eyes.
His companion, who hastily dropped a veil over
her face as the door was opened, shrank back into
her chair and turned her head away.</p>

<p>She was slender of figure, and seemed to be
rather good-looking. Owing to the thick veil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Nick could not distinguish the full outlines of her
face, but what he could see of it gave him the impression
that the woman was young, and fair of
complexion. There was something about the
droop of the shoulders, the graceful lines of the
waist, which seemed familiar to the detective, yet
he could not at that time place the woman.</p>

<p>“What do you want in here?” demanded Mantelle,
springing from his chair. “Have you no
eyes? Can’t you see that the room is taken?”</p>

<p>“Just a moment,” said Nick, with the precinct-detective
swagger. “I’m a police detective, you
know.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t know,” replied the other hotly,
“but if you are, what is that to me? Have the
kindness to leave the room.”</p>

<p>Chick was looking on in amused wonder. He
had never seen his chief play that rôle before.</p>

<p>“I have business with you,” said Nick, taking a
chair.</p>

<p>It seemed to Nick that a shade of anxiety,
passed over the man’s face.</p>

<p>“Well, proceed. What is it?”</p>

<p>“You were here with Townsend and Maynard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
last night when the latter was murdered?” asked
the detective.</p>

<p>“You are wrong,” was the reply. “You don’t
know what you are talking about.”</p>

<p>“You were not here that night?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“Yes, I was here, but not with Mr. Townsend.
He had left the place before I arrived, and I
found Maynard waiting for him.”</p>

<p>“You did not see Townsend that night?” asked
Nick, regarding the fellow keenly.</p>

<p>Mantelle hesitated. He looked like a man who
was playing for time.</p>

<p>“I was told that you saw him out on the pavement
in front of this place,” said Nick, at a venture.</p>

<p>“Well, what if I did? I do not at this time recall
the incident, if I did see him; but what of it if
I did?”</p>

<p>“I am also informed,” said Nick, still making a
bluff, “that you saw him pass down the street
without making your presence known. Is that
true?”</p>

<p>“It is not true,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“We have information at headquarters,” continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Nick, “that you walked on to the Wisconsin
in his wake, and returned to the café only after
the cry that a murder had been committed had
been raised in the hotel.”</p>

<p>“That is not true,” said Mantelle.</p>

<p>“You did not go to the Wisconsin that night?”
asked the detective.</p>

<p>“I did not,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“When you left here, leaving Maynard to look
up his friend, where did you go?”</p>

<p>“That is no affair of yours,” was the angry
reply.</p>

<p>Nick was doing a lot of guessing in his talk
with the fellow, but he seemed to be making
points.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you go to the house of an African fortune
teller on Houston Street?” asked the detective.</p>

<p>“It is a lie!” almost shouted Mantelle. “What
does all this questioning mean? Am I accused
of the murder of Townsend? If so, take me to
some competent person for examination. I am
sick of your amateur efforts.”</p>

<p>“All in good time,” said Nick. “After the destruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
by fire of the house occupied by the African
fortune teller, didn’t you visit a woman on
the third floor of a tenement house near the Bowery?”</p>

<p>Mantelle started. The woman sitting by his
side seemed about to leave her chair, so excited
and nervous were her movements. Chick began
to see that his chief was no longer feeling around
for a clue, but knew what he was about.</p>

<p>“I did not visit such a place as you describe,”
was the reply. “From this café I went directly to
my rooms at the Cumberland.”</p>

<p>“How did you get to your rooms?” asked Nick,
at a venture. “The elevator man says you did not
ride up in the cage with him.”</p>

<p>Again the fellow started, as if in sudden terror,
again the woman made a motion which suggested
leaving the room. Nick was now playing a bold
game.</p>

<p>“He is mistaken,” said Mantelle. “I went to
my room in the usual manner.”</p>

<p>“And the lady sitting there by your side,” said
Nick, “she——”</p>

<p>“Leave her out of it,” said Mantelle angrily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>“She met you later that night—or early the
next morning, rather, at——”</p>

<p>The woman sprang to her feet, her eyes flashing
through her veil.</p>

<p>“I won’t stay here to be insulted!” she said.</p>

<p>She started for the door, but Nick stopped her
with a gesture.</p>

<p>“Wait,” he said. “Are you the woman who
occupied a room on the third story of a tenement
on East Houston Street?”</p>

<p>“Let me pass,” cried the woman, as Nick
stepped in front of her. “I can account for myself
to the proper authorities, but not to you.”</p>

<p>In her rage the woman drew herself up to her
full height and gazed at the detective, with a
fierce hate burning in her eyes.</p>

<p>“It may be as well for you to remain here and
answer a few questions, but you may go if you
think best,” said Nick.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” demanded the woman.</p>

<p>“This: When did you first meet Julius Mantelle?”</p>

<p>Mantelle now sprang to his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>“This is intolerable!” he cried.</p>

<p>“I am not detaining you,” said Nick.</p>

<p>Mantelle and the woman turned to the door.</p>

<p>“A nice mess you have made of my morning,”
Julius said.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.
<br />
<small>FLUSHING THE BIRDS.</small></h2>


<p>A waiter approached, a tall, dark, slim fellow,
with evident traces of African blood in his veins.
He stepped impudently in front of the detectives
as they followed Julius and the woman from the
room. His manner was insulting in the extreme.</p>

<p>“How did you get into that room?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Nick sized up the situation instantly. Some
of their conversation had been overheard, and this
waiter had been set on to detain them while the
man and woman got away. Either that, or assault,
perhaps murder, was intended. It was
clear that he had made progress during his talk
with Mantelle.</p>

<p>Without replying to the impudent question of
the waiter, Nick motioned him to step aside, and
advanced toward the public room, which lay at
the end of a wide hall upon which the private
room opened. At the rear of the hall was a wide
door opening on an alley. The waiter did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
move. He still obstructed the way. Julius and
the woman were passing through the outer room
toward the street door.</p>

<p>“You had no right in there,” continued the
waiter, angry at the way he was ignored, “and
I have a notion to throw you out into the alley.”</p>

<p>“Mention of the Townsend murder appears to
stir things up in this house,” said the detective,
looking the waiter in the eye.</p>

<p>For a second the fellow looked dismayed, but
only for a second. Other waiters were now gathering
in the hall. The clerk advanced to the scene
of trouble.</p>

<p>“We can’t have quarreling here,” he said.
“You go back to your work,” he added, addressing
the waiters, “and you,” to the detectives,
“make your way out as quietly as possible. I told
you not to go into that room.”</p>

<p>“At any rate,” thought Nick, “the clerk is not
in with this play, whatever it is.”</p>

<p>“He can’t come in here and insult my customers,”
said the waiter, ignoring the protests of the
clerk. “I’ll pitch him into the alley.”</p>

<p>“The alley is probably half full of bullies,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
thought Nick, “and I have no time for a battle
now. The waiter is in touch with the syndicate.”</p>

<p>The waiter seized Nick by the shoulder and
hurried him along toward the alley door, and
Nick went without resistance. He wanted to see
what there was in the alley.</p>

<p>Another waiter seized Chick and moved forward
with him. It seemed to be the idea to separate
the two men. Chick waited until the alley
door was opened, and then landed a blow on the
waiter which laid him unconscious on the floor.</p>

<p>Through the doorway leading to the alley the
assistant had observed three muscular men waiting
for Nick to be passed out to them! Surely the
detective had had good cause to begin a line of inquiries
at this place!</p>

<p>In a moment Chick was at the side of his chief,
who was still inside the restaurant. There was a
rush for the place, half a dozen waiters swarming
about the two detectives. Chick saw iron knuckles
in more than one hand, and understood that the
intention was to knock them both out.</p>

<p>As he approached, he saw Nick whirl suddenly
about, land a knockout blow on the waiter’s jaw,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
and make toward the front of the place. Two
waiters were now down, and all was excitement,
but no one opposed the exit of the detectives. Two
of their crack men had been knocked out, and that
was enough to warn the others to be careful. At
the door Nick beckoned to a policeman, a roundsman,
who knew him well.</p>

<p>“I had to do a little hitting in there,” he said
to the policeman. “Go in and take the two men
you will find suffering from too much impudence.
Lock them up, and keep them apart and away
from visitors.”</p>

<p>The roundsman saluted and passed into the restaurant.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Nick, “we may as well learn where
Julius and the woman go.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid they’re out of sight,” said Chick.</p>

<p>“No, they were waiting to see us beaten to a
pulp,” replied Nick. “They have just left the
stairway there at the left and turned the corner.
Keep along after them and track them home. If
they separate, follow the woman.”</p>

<p>Chick hastened away, and Nick made his way
to his office, where he found Patsy awaiting him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have looked up the details of the four diamond
robberies,” said the assistant, “and here is
the report.”</p>

<p>He handed his chief a typewritten roll of at
least twenty thousand words. Nick glanced at
the length of the document, and asked:</p>

<p>“How many hands show plainly in these jobs?”</p>

<p>“One in the last three,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“And all these are of recent occurrence?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of very recent occurrence.”</p>

<p>“And the proof points to a woman?”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a woman?”</p>

<p>“A lady’s maid.”</p>

<p>“Describe her.”</p>

<p>Patsy laughed as he replied:</p>

<p>“That would be a hard thing for me to do,
though my wife, Adelina, might satisfy you.
Sometimes she is young and fair. Again, she is
old and wrinkled. Now she has abundant black
hair, now she has short auburn locks. She seemed
to be an expert at disguises, for no one suspected
her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yet you are certain of your ground?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. The face does not always do its
duty when disguised. There are features which
cannot be changed by art. This girl has a small
mole on the right upper lip, just at the corner of
the nostril.”</p>

<p>“That is a very common face blemish.”</p>

<p>“Exactly, but this girl has tried to secure the
removal of this blemish, and it has resented the
interference. It is inflamed, and is growing in
size.”</p>

<p>“What else?”</p>

<p>“She is young.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that?”</p>

<p>“She looks it. She can’t be over twenty.”</p>

<p>“Where did she appear as a young woman?”</p>

<p>“At the Burns house.”</p>

<p>“Go on.”</p>

<p>“She is slender, and has a fancy for diamonds.”</p>

<p>“Go on.”</p>

<p>“Just now she is not in evidence. No one seems
to know where she is.”</p>

<p>“You did not unnecessarily attract attention to
her?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, no. She is not supposed to be suspected.
I was looking after a long-lost sister.”</p>

<p>“Can you ascertain where she put in her extra
time while out at service?”</p>

<p>“I have already done so. She was infatuated
with the stage. She went to the theatres, and
sought the companionship of actors and actresses.
She informed the servants at the Burns house
that she was in training for the stage.”</p>

<p>“She may be behind the footlights now.”</p>

<p>“I can’t find her at any of the theatres.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the detective, “about ten o’clock
to-night I may be able to point her out to you. Remain
here for the present.”</p>

<p>In an hour a call from Chick came over the
phone. He was in a room opposite a private parlor
at the Cumberland.</p>

<p>“Our parties are across the hall,” he said, “and
they seem to be holding a reception. About a
dozen people in there now, and more coming.”</p>

<p>“What sort of people?”</p>

<p>“Pretty good-looking lot. Look like hotel
clerks, restaurant owners, and race-horse fellows
of the better class.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mantelle master of ceremonies?”</p>

<p>“He appears to be.”</p>

<p>“Any way of learning what they are talking
about?”</p>

<p>“I can’t get a single word.”</p>

<p>“Is Julius dressed just as he was this afternoon
at the café?”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll be up there in a short time.”</p>

<p>Nick rang off, and made up a bundle from the
clothing stored in his dressing room. Then he
turned to Patsy.</p>

<p>“You saw the clothes I put up?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you see me in that rig, follow on,
wherever I go. Perhaps you would better get on
your messenger rig. You can go anywhere in
that, in the part of the city where I am going.”</p>

<p>Patsy hastened away to prepare his change of
apparel. Nick regarded his own disguise ruefully.
It was without doubt necessary in this
case, but he disliked to go about in the guise of
another man. He preferred to win his cases by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
reasoning them out rather than by cheap detective
methods.</p>

<p>As soon as Patsy was ready, Nick took up his
bundle with a sigh, and the two made their way to
the Cumberland, Patsy following along on the
opposite side of the street.</p>

<p>“Step into the corridor and note the room I am
shown to,” said Nick, waiting for the seeming
messenger to come up with him at the entrance to
the hotel. “After I have been in there a minute,
tell the clerk you have a message for the man in
that room. Come in armed and ready for a
scrap.”</p>

<p>“A scrap at the Cumberland?” echoed Patsy.</p>

<p>“We can’t tell what will happen,” replied Nick.</p>

<p>It was now growing dark, and when Nick entered
the room where Chick awaited him, the gas
was burning dimly.</p>

<p>In a moment the detective had his clothes off
and was dressing himself in the ones brought
from his office. As the work progressed, Patsy
knocked at the door, and was admitted.</p>

<p>Directly, Nick stood before his assistants ready
for action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>It seemed to them that it was Mantelle who
stood there.</p>

<p>“It is a hard rôle to play,” said Nick, “because
it is difficult to hold my face as Mantelle carries
his. Anything wrong?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing!” said Chick.</p>

<p>“You look like the original,” said Patsy.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Nick, “I’d like to get in there and
hear the talk, but I do not care to risk it, as a failure
would ruin all my plans.”</p>

<p>“What’s the game?” asked Patsy.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to remain here until they leave,”
was the reply.</p>

<p>“That may be at midnight.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we must wait.”</p>

<p>“And then?”</p>

<p>“When we see that they are going, the messenger
steps out and invites Mantelle into this room.”</p>

<p>“And we put him to sleep, and you step out in
his place?”</p>

<p>“That’s it.”</p>

<p>“It’s a risky thing to do,” said Chick.</p>

<p>Nick remained silent.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.
<br />
<small>A CLEVER WOMAN.</small></h2>


<p>“There is no knowing where the trail may lead
you,” Chick said presently.</p>

<p>“I am in hope,” said Nick, “that it will lead
again to the headquarters of the Great Diamond
Syndicate. I have an idea that I would like a
short talk with the man I met in the Houston
Street house last night.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what’s become of the alleged reporter?”
asked Chick. “He appeared to me to be
rather an amusing chap.”</p>

<p>“You’ll probably find him with the old duffer
who entertained Nick last night,” suggested
Patsy. “Listen! I think they are passing out.”</p>

<p>The people in the private parlor were indeed
leaving the room, one at a time, and quietly.
There was no talking in the hall, and the door
was closed after every departure. Nick smiled
at the game he was playing.</p>

<p>“These syndicate fellows are all right,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
said. “It is something worth while when you get
up against fellows who meet at first-class hotels
instead of in some dark basement in the slums!”</p>

<p>The door to the private room opened and closed
again. Nick, who was at the transom, motioned,
and Patsy slipped out into the hall and stood some
distance from the door.</p>

<p>“There are only two left in the room now,” said
Nick. “They are Mantelle and a woman.”</p>

<p>Again the door opened, and Mantelle stepped
out. The woman was a few paces behind him,
but still in the room.</p>

<p>Patsy stepped forward from the other end of
the hall.</p>

<p>“I was just going to the parlor, sir,” he said.
“I have a message for you.”</p>

<p>“Deliver it,” said Julius shortly.</p>

<p>“A call, rather,” said Patsy, correcting his mistake.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“It is a request to call at room fourteen. That
is it, there at the right.”</p>

<p>Julius made a motion with his hand, and the
woman closed the door of the private parlor. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
then stepped up to the door of fourteen and
knocked lightly on the panel.</p>

<p>“You asked for me?” he said, as Chick opened
the door.</p>

<p>Nick was nowhere in sight. The messenger
followed on as Julius stepped into the room.</p>

<p>It all took place in a second, and Mantelle lay
bound, gagged, and panting on the carpet.</p>

<p>“That was quietly done,” said Nick, stepping
out of a closet. “I was afraid the noise might attract
attention.”</p>

<p>Mantelle almost foamed with rage as he saw
Nick, dressed so exactly like himself that it would
seem that his best friends must be deceived.</p>

<p>Chick mounted a chair and looked through the
transom.</p>

<p>“You must be going,” he said presently. “The
woman in the parlor is becoming anxious and
keeps opening the door a crack.”</p>

<p>Nick bent over Mantelle, lying helpless on the
floor, and took a peculiar-looking pin from his
scarf. Then he took a diamond ring from the
prisoner’s little finger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>Mantelle squirmed under his bonds, but could
not resist.</p>

<p>“I can use these to good advantage,” said Nick.
“And, by the way, Mantelle, I think I have seen
these before.”</p>

<p>The prisoner looked as if a little cursing would
relieve his mind, but he did not at that time have
the power to make a loud sound.</p>

<p>“The woman is at the door,” said Chick.</p>

<p>Nick opened the door and stepped out into the
hall.</p>

<p>“I was detained a moment in that room,” he
said, as the woman advanced to meet him.</p>

<p>Julius foamed as he realized how exactly the
voice reproduced his own.</p>

<p>“Looks all right, doesn’t he?” asked Chick, as
he closed the door. “Now, when they get to the
end of the hall, Patsy, you follow on, and I’ll see
that this fellow is locked up.”</p>

<p>Patsy moved away, and was soon in full view
of Nick and his companion. They were standing
in front of a clothing house, and the woman was
urging him to make some purchases.</p>

<p>The woman had apparently not even glanced at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
Nick as he appeared in the hall in the guise of
Mantelle. She had walked at his side until they
were clear of the hotel without speaking. Now
she said:</p>

<p>“It is plain that we must leave the city for a
time.”</p>

<p>“I presume so,” said Nick.</p>

<p>The woman walked along in silence while Nick
wondered what was coming next. He saw no
reason for sudden flight on the part of the members
of the syndicate; that is, unless they had
learned something of his plans.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why that police detective suspected
you,” continued the woman. “Why don’t you
change your clothes and make yourself look different?
You poke around in that black suit, looking
like a preacher. Fix your hair different, and
put on a sporty air. You look too solemn.”</p>

<p>“I must go back to my room to do that,” said
Nick, realizing that this was just the thing he
ought to do—get to Mantelle’s rooms. But it was
not in the mind of the woman that he should reach
that suite of rooms.</p>

<p>“Here is a clothing store,” she said. “Go in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
and buy what you need. You must not go back
to the rooms now. The hotel is probably watched.
It’s a wonder we all got away from there as we
did after the meeting. You buy what you need
here, and I’ll wait in front of the store. Change
your appearance as much as possible.”</p>

<p>Nick was sorely puzzled. Why should the
woman want him to change his clothes? She understood
that the officers knew Mantelle, and that
they would find him if they wanted to do so in
whatever suit he might put on. Was it her purpose
to escape when he went into the store to
change his clothes? That was a risk he could not
run, and he hesitated at the store door. Then a
messenger in uniform paused at the door, looked
at the number, and passed on.</p>

<p>“That’s Patsy, all right,” thought Nick; “here’s
for the new clothes. She can’t get away so long
as he is here. This is a mystery, but I’ll solve it!”</p>

<p>Nick selected a large, light-colored suit, and put
it on over the Mantelle disguise. The hat he retained,
for he could not very well conceal the
derby he had worn. When he left the dressing
room he seemed like another person. The woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
looked pleased, and asked where the other clothes
were.</p>

<p>“I have them where I can get them again,” was
the reply.</p>

<p>Once more in the street, the woman turned at
the corner of Houston and walked in the direction
of the East River. She seemed strangely agitated
over something, and more than once Nick thought
she was laughing immoderately.</p>

<p>The detective began to think he had caught a
Tartar. At least, he could not make up his mind
as to what was coming off next.</p>

<p>The house she presently entered was in the
same block with the ruins of the burned headquarters
of the Great Diamond Syndicate.</p>

<p>She led the way up a staircase, and entered a
suite of rooms which faced the street. Closing
the door, she laid aside her hat and coat and faced
the detective with a smile.</p>

<p>She was a handsome woman, tall, slender, and
fair of face, but certainly not the one Nick had
seen at the café with Mantelle. She said:</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Nick Carter!”</p>

<p>Nick sprang back, but before he could draw a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
weapon he found himself looking into the muzzle
of a loaded revolver. The woman certainly had
the drop on him! Then a young man came from
an inner room and took the revolver while the
woman went through the form of securing Nick’s
wrists. The detective did not resist. He knew
that he could release himself from his bonds at
any time. They were not of the kind used by the
chief of the Great Diamond Syndicate.</p>

<p>This accomplished, the woman stepped back
and looked the detective over contemptuously.</p>

<p>“You thought I wouldn’t recognize you?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“I certainly did,” was the reply. “How did you
account for my wearing Mantelle’s jewelry?”</p>

<p>“I imagined what had taken place in room fourteen.
You are a man of action, Mr. Carter, but
you have your failings. You neglected to give the
sign when we met in the hall.”</p>

<p>“I was wondering if there were signs and
grips,” said Nick. “Rather a clever lot of thieves
and murderers.”</p>

<p>“Don’t become coarse,” said the woman. “Of
course we have signs and grips.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Nick recalled a sign Mantelle had made
at the café when the waiters came to the private
room. It was nothing more than dropping the
left hand straight at the side and pointing down
with the index finger, the others being closed.</p>

<p>Nick knew that he was in no little peril. It was
true that he could cast off his bonds at any time,
and might even be able to outwit the woman and
her companion, but he knew well enough that
other members of the syndicate were about.</p>

<p>“Are you waiting for some one?” asked Nick,
as the woman walked about the room.</p>

<p>“Yes; I am waiting for Mantelle,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>“You will find him in the Tombs,” said Nick.</p>

<p>“Your plans do not appear to be working to
perfection in this case,” said the woman mockingly.
“Mantelle will be rescued on the way to
prison.”</p>

<p>“And when he arrives here?”</p>

<p>“Then you will be executed. We shall take no
more chances. Do you know that you have given
us more trouble than any dozen men ever did?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>“Executed,” repeated the detective. “You use
a fine word to describe the crime of murder.”</p>

<p>“Executed is the word. You were condemned
to death a long time ago.”</p>

<p>Nick glanced about the room. There seemed to
be no way out except by the door at which he had
entered. The woman noticed his scrutiny of the
place, and said:</p>

<p>“Oh, we have taken good care that you shall
not slip us again. Even if you could get out of
the room, you would be killed in the street. Our
men are warned, and are anxious to dispose of
you.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” said Nick, “that I have heard
talk something like that before, and in this case,
too. Is it the habit of the syndicate to explain its
plans to prisoners who are condemned to death?
You appear to me to be quite frank in your statements.”</p>

<p>“The chief made a mistake in talking to you
last night, or this morning, rather,” replied the
woman. “It made us no end of trouble to-day.”</p>

<p>The woman arose and walked to the window.
To the detective she seemed to be getting nervous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you know,” said Nick presently, “that I
think you are putting up a bluff, and that you are
talking against time? Is Mantelle late?”</p>

<p>“He’ll be here,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“It would be something of a consolation to me,”
said Nick, “to know just how you managed to scatter
the news of my capture. The others were
gone when we left the hotel, before you suspected
me, and you have talked with no one since we
started.”</p>

<p>The woman laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose I got you into that clothing
store for, and into the dressing room? I am
agreeably disappointed in you. I thought you
much keener.”</p>

<p>“Then you discovered my identity at once, in
the hotel, and summoned your friends while I was
changing my clothes? That’s clever! What a
capital detective you would have made. I should
not have left you alone for an instant. You might
have escaped. But, then, we all make mistakes.”</p>

<p>Nick waited anxiously, half expecting the
woman to mention the presence of Patsy while she
sat at the front of the store. Patsy had certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
been there, but had the woman noted his presence?
It was a consolation to the detective to
know that the assistant was not far off.</p>

<p>“I was afraid you would escape,” laughed the
woman. “You took the hook easily, Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p>“You are a clever woman,” replied Nick. “I
give you the credit of getting the best of me up to
date. What next, if I may ask?”</p>

<p>“If you could look out of the window,” said the
woman, facing Houston Street, “you would see
three men lounging in front of a saloon. They
are waiting for signals from this room. Do you
begin to realize what a power the Great Diamond
Syndicate is? When the waving of a red handkerchief
announces that you are dead they will go
away. But they won’t expect that signal until
they see Mantelle enter the house.”</p>

<p>The detective had no doubt that Patsy was also
watching the windows of that house. He would
have given much to have communicated with him
for an instant.</p>

<p>He arose as if to walk to the window. The
young man who held the revolver moved forward
into the front room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>“Get back to your chair,” he said, “or we won’t
wait for Mantelle. I prefer to do the job right
now, anyway. Get back!”</p>

<p>The fellow’s tone nettled the detective. Almost
before he realized what he was doing, he burst
his bonds and sprang at the man. There was a
sharp report and a puff of smoke.</p>

<p>Then the woman, who had turned from the
window in alarm, saw the young man lying unconscious
on the floor, and saw, also, that the detective
was no longer bound.</p>

<p>Nick gazed at the woman steadily for a second.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to do with you,” he said.
“It is not the office of a gentleman to bind and gag
a woman, yet something must be done.”</p>

<p>The woman gazed anxiously in the direction of
the door.</p>

<p>“Don’t expect Mantelle,” said Nick. “He is in
the Tombs by this time.”</p>

<p>Then a step sounded in the hall outside.</p>

<p>“He is coming!” cried the woman.</p>

<p>Nick lifted his revolver.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” he said.</p>

<p>The woman gave a scream of warning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the door opened, and a messenger’s uniform
showed in the opening.</p>

<p>Patsy was evidently in great haste, and closed
the door after him with a bang.</p>

<p>“Those fellows across the street are suspicious,”
he said. “I should not have made a break
to get up here except for the pistol shot. Are you
hurt?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” replied Nick. “Are the
watchers coming up here?”</p>

<p>“They started across the street just behind me.”</p>

<p>“Watch the woman!”</p>

<p>Nick sprang to the front window. The red silk
handkerchief lay in a chair, ready for use as a
signal.</p>

<p>Nick lifted the lower sash and threw the end
out to the breeze. It floated for a second in the
strong light of the street, and then Nick dropped
it. As it fluttered to the pavement below, the detective
caught an exclamation of joy from a group
of three men standing at the very entrance to the
house.</p>

<p>“There you are,” said Nick, turning back into
the room with a smile. “I am now dead, and our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
three cutthroats will go away. How are you feeling
now, madam?” he added, speaking to the
woman, who had thrown herself into a chair and
sat looking at the two men with rage and hate in
her eyes.</p>

<p>While Patsy watched the prisoner, Nick made
a search of the rooms.</p>

<p>He found letters and telegrams by the score.
His conclusion was that the Great Diamond Syndicate
was using the rooms as headquarters.</p>

<p>As he opened a locked drawer in a small secretary,
the woman sprang to her feet and fought
desperately.</p>

<p>“They are private papers there,” she cried. “If
you are a gentleman, let them alone. Let them
alone, I tell you!”</p>

<p>“Private papers!” echoed Nick. “I should say
so! The private papers of the Great Diamond
Syndicate! This is indeed a find!”</p>

<p>The woman fell back on the floor in a faint.</p>

<p>“This looks like easy money!” smiled Patsy,
with a grin.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.
<br />
<small>THE STORY TOLD.</small></h2>


<p>The Booth Dramatic Club was holding rehearsal
at its rooms on West Fourteenth Street.
The rooms were on the top floor of an old-fashioned
house, and were nicely fitted up with stage,
dressing room, and scenery.</p>

<p>The play long in rehearsal was to have been
presented to the intimate friends of the members
of the club that night, but the death of Townsend,
the illness of Maynard, and the strange disappearance
of two young men who held leading
parts had made a postponement necessary.</p>

<p>There was a stage entrance from a hall which
ran along the east side of the house, and at eight
o’clock Nick Carter, in the guise of Mantelle,
passed through the hall and stepped out on the
stage. He was accompanied by Patsy, who carried
a large suit case.</p>

<p>“I wonder which is my dressing room?” whispered
Nick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>Patsy looked amused. The two detectives had
run many risks in getting into the house and up
to the rooms of the club, but the test now seemed
at hand.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the assistant, “you’ve got a leading
rôle, according to the programme we found,
and you must have a fine dressing room. Wait!
I’ll just scout around and find a room with your
stage costume in it. If I make a mistake no one
will wonder at it, while they would suspect something
at once if you got into the wrong room.</p>

<p>“There,” said Patsy, returning in a moment.
“I’ve located the place and the rig. I hope you’ll
make a hit in your part to-night! You wear a wig
and all that, so no one will suspect you. What
luck! Sure I don’t play anything? Well, then,
I’ll be your servant for the night, and sit in the
dressing room and watch.”</p>

<p>Nick dressed in the costume he wore in the
play, and went out on the stage. Half a dozen
of the members were there, and he nodded at
them all, giving the sign with the left hand. They
were all too busy with their own affairs to pay
special attention to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently a dressing-room door opened, and a
woman stepped out, clad in silks and blazing with
diamonds. She approached Nick, who was glad
that at the moment he stood in the shadow of a
scene ready for adjustment.</p>

<p>The girl was Bernice Bouvé. She looked more
beautiful than ever in her costume. In a moment
Anton Sawtelle stood at her side.</p>

<p>“Where is Stella?” asked Bernice, laying a
hand on Nick’s arm. “She should have been here
long ago.”</p>

<p>“Now, who is Stella?” wondered Nick. “She
must be the clever woman who captured me this
evening. I’ll take a chance.</p>

<p>“She left me soon after leaving the Cumberland,”
he said, “saying that she would be here on
time. You look superb in those diamonds!”</p>

<p>Bernice smiled and Anton grinned.</p>

<p>“You always admired the Maynard collection,”
she said.</p>

<p>Here was another puzzle for the detective.
Had the thieves the nerve to present the stolen
diamonds at the rehearsal? Could it be possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
that no member of the club, outside those who belonged
to the syndicate, knew of the true situation
of affairs, of the murder of Townsend and the
assault on Maynard?</p>

<p>“It strikes me,” thought Nick, “that this dramatic
club is composed principally of members of
the Great Diamond Syndicate.”</p>

<p>The detective shuddered as Bernice touched
him, but he remained in conversation with her for
a long time.</p>

<p>“There comes the chief,” she said presently,
pointing to a brisk-appearing man just stepping
on the stage. He was accompanied by a young
fellow Nick had no difficulty in recognizing as the
alleged reporter who had led him to the syndicate
headquarters. There was no doubt that the man
referred to as the chief was the same one who had
planned his death the previous evening.</p>

<p>In looking over the members of the club, Nick
saw that it was indeed composed mostly of members
of the syndicate. The few outsiders who
were there were the lambs of the organization.
They had either diamonds, money, or social position
to thank for their admission. Nick now saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
clearly what the club really was, an annex to the
syndicate.</p>

<p>While the others were at their parts, Nick went
back to his dressing room.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do when it comes time
for you to go on?” asked Patsy. “You don’t know
a word of the part.”</p>

<p>“If Chick acts promptly,” said Nick, “the big
scene will come off before I am called upon to
speak my lines.”</p>

<p>“It will be something of a surprise party,” said
Patsy. “Still, there are not so many members of
the syndicate here that we know about. You have
Mantelle, Stella, the two waiters, the guard at the
old headquarters, and the man who tried to burglarize
your house already under arrest. How
many more are there here?”</p>

<p>“The chief,” replied Nick, “the alleged reporter,
Bernice, Anton, and the members of that
glee club. Oh, we’ll pick them all up if everything
goes well.”</p>

<p>“When does it come off?”</p>

<p>“Very shortly, now.”</p>

<p>At that moment there came a knock on the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
leading to the hall. One of the members of the
club opened it, and six men, wearing the white
uniforms of caterer’s men, walked in, bearing
great baskets covered with white cloths.</p>

<p>“A surprise!” cried half a dozen voices.</p>

<p>“A feed!” said Bernice, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Who is responsible for this?” asked the chief.</p>

<p>The baskets were placed in the centre of the
stage, and the members of the company gathered
about them.</p>

<p>Nick and Patsy stood back where the men who
had brought the baskets could see every move they
made.</p>

<p>Then, when the entire company was bending
over the baskets, Nick gave a signal and seized
the chief of the Great Diamond Syndicate!</p>

<p>There were screams, calls for help, and frantic
efforts at escape, but in a moment every member
of the club who belonged to the villainous diamond
syndicate was securely handcuffed.</p>

<p>“How was that for a spread?” asked Chick,
who had seized Anton.</p>

<p>“What does it mean?” demanded the chief,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
looking hard at Nick, still wearing the stage costume
prepared for Mantelle.</p>

<p>Nick threw off his rig and stood revealed.</p>

<p>“I think,” said the chief coolly, “that we have
met before.”</p>

<p>“Right you are,” said Nick, “and under different
circumstances. How do you like the change
of positions?”</p>

<p>“I should like to have you as a working partner,”
said the chief. “You are courageous and
resourceful, yet you sometimes make mistakes.
You have made a scene here to-night and arrested
practically all the members of this club. What
charge can you make against us?”</p>

<p>The members of the club who had not been
arrested now gathered around.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” they asked.</p>

<p>They were mostly the sons and daughters of
wealthy people, and they would in time have fallen
victims to the syndicate.</p>

<p>“It means,” replied Nick, “that you have been
associating with murderers and robbers ever since
you joined this club.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is strong talk,” said the chief. “Be careful
what you say.”</p>

<p>Bernice Bouvé, who had been standing by
Nick’s side, now sprang away as if to make her
escape by means of a window.</p>

<p>“Would you commit suicide?” asked the detective,
restraining her. “It would be death to leap
from that window.”</p>

<p>“And it is death to remain here!” cried the girl.</p>

<p>The next moment she fell in a faint at the feet
of the detective.</p>

<p>As she sank to the floor her hair caught on a
button of Nick’s coat, and came off, revealing a
short under wig of red hair.</p>

<p>“There!” said Patsy. “We have found the
lady’s maid who made up in so many different
ways. See! She wore long black hair, then a
wig of red, then her own black hair, cut short.”</p>

<p>“Cut short at the prison,” said Nick.</p>

<p>The head of the syndicate stepped forward and
looked down upon the girl.</p>

<p>“I never supposed she lacked nerve,” he said.</p>

<p>“The electric chair has terrors for all,” said
Nick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>The chief remained silent. By this time the
members of the club who were not under arrest
were leaving the room, never to return. The
prisoners were grouped on one corner of the
stage, some of them in the costumes they had prepared
for the play, which was now destined never
to be presented by the club.</p>

<p>Nick picked up jewels as they fell from the unconscious
girl.</p>

<p>“It seems,” he said, “that Bernice cannot prove
true even to her associates in crime. All the larger
stones here are paste. How the girl substituted
them for the real diamonds in one day’s time is
more than I can tell.”</p>

<p>The chief of the syndicate and Anton stepped
forward in angry wonder.</p>

<p>The chief muttered a savage oath.</p>

<p>“I have suspected the girl all along,” he said.
“That is why she has always been followed.”</p>

<p>“For all that,” said Nick, “she was your best
assistant. She did her work cleverly and left no
clue, as a rule. I can’t understand how she came
to murder Townsend.”</p>

<p>“She never did!” shouted Anton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wait!” said the chief of the syndicate. “We
can’t protect her in the crime which was not authorized
by the syndicate. She murdered Townsend
because he recognized her.”</p>

<p>“And she and Mantelle, who is now in the
Tombs, attempted the life of Maynard because he
saw their faces and heard their talk? Is that it?”</p>

<p>The chief was silent.</p>

<p>“You can’t prove what you say,” said Anton,
bending over the girl, who now showed signs of
returning consciousness. “If that fool of a chief
would only keep his mouth shut!”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Nick. “You say I have no
proof. Let me tell you how the crimes were committed.
When Anton and Bernice were released
from prison, the Great Diamond Syndicate went
after them, and they readily agreed to become
members of that unlawful organization. They
executed the four robberies I have named, Bernice
playing the part of lady’s maid and Anton following
her about as her lover. Then they came to
the Maynard diamonds.</p>

<p>“This dramatic club was formed, and a play
which called for the display of a large number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
diamonds was selected. The conspirators,
through Mantelle, induced people of wealth to
join, Maynard and Townsend among others.
Maynard foolishly promised the use of his diamonds,
and other members agreed to bring minor
collections.</p>

<p>“At the dress rehearsal last night Maynard
produced his gems. Then the game seemed ready
to work. Mantelle made an appointment at the
African fortune teller’s. By the way, Stella, the
fortune teller is at present in the Tombs, charged
with murder. While Mantelle and the gang were
making things ready, Maynard and Townsend
waited at a café. One member of the syndicate
overheard what they said about getting rid of the
diamonds. Bernice, having more nerve than the
others, was appointed to get the stones. She was
dressed in man’s clothes, because that disguise
was believed to be perfect. While the officers
were looking for a man who had committed the
crime, the guilty one would be back in her own
habiliments.</p>

<p>“You all know how Townsend was followed
and murdered. The chief undoubtedly told the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
truth. Townsend recognized Bernice, even under
her disguise, and so was killed. Then the syndicate,
terribly frightened, turned its energies toward
defense. It was thought best to watch and
destroy the detective who took the case in hand.
But they did not expect that work would begin
so soon. They were expecting a police detective.
I was led to the headquarters of the syndicate,
you all know how, and escaped.</p>

<p>“When the headquarters were burned for the
purpose of destroying the records, Bernice was
at the Wisconsin with Mantelle, trying to find a
ring she had lost in the room where the murder
was committed. She did not find it, because I
picked it up on my first visit to the place. I knew
then whose ring it was. I had seen her wear it at
the Maynard home when she was a maid there.</p>

<p>“On their way out of the hotel, the elevator
boy gave them the suit of clothes she had worn
and which I had committed to the charge of the
clerk.”</p>

<p>The girl opened her eyes and arose slowly to
her feet.</p>

<p>“You are telling a mess of lies!” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>“The suit you wore when you murdered Townsend,”
said Nick, “is now at my office. I found
it in the closet off Stella’s room on Houston
Street. Anton bought it in Paris, and it was
made over to fit you. The suit of Townsend’s,
which you wore away, was found in the same
place.”</p>

<p>“If they were in Stella’s room, why don’t you
accuse her of the murder?” demanded Anton.</p>

<p>“Because the chief admits that Bernice committed
the crime,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“If she goes to the electric chair, he shall go
with her,” said the young man significantly. “He
is as guilty as any one.”</p>

<p>The chief of the syndicate sprang forward.</p>

<p>“You traitor!” he shouted. “You are telling
lies!”</p>

<p>“Lies!” echoed Anton; “who planned the murder
of the elevator boy, after he had been bribed
and used? You did, and Stella threw the jar
from the window of her room when he passed
along there, directed to that place by you!”</p>

<p>“That is just the proof I have been looking
for,” said Nick. “My friend, the chief, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
have made way with me last night. It gives me
great pleasure to send him to the Tombs on charge
of murder.”</p>

<p>The chief of the diamond thieves, who had been
so vain and so confident of his own ability only a
short time before, now cringed with terror.</p>

<p>“They all had a hand in the affair of the boy,”
he shouted. “We passed upon the matter at a full
meeting of the local branch of the syndicate. If
I go to the electric chair, they go with me.”</p>

<p>“I would go willingly,” said Bernice, “if I could
take this devil of a detective with me. You
thought yourselves able to outwit him! See what
has come to you!”</p>

<p>“At any rate,” said Chick, “the Great Diamond
Syndicate tried its best, and at one time I thought
we were up against a stiff game. You see,” he
added, “all the clues in this case have been supplied
by members of the syndicate!”</p>

<p>“Bad management!” shouted Anton. “I knew
it all along. I told you what Nick Carter could
do, and yet you allowed him to live when you had
him bound.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that is Nick Carter,” said another.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
“I waited under Stella’s window to-night
and received from her a signal showing that he
had been killed.”</p>

<p>“You’re a fool!” shouted Anton. “That signal
was given by Nick Carter himself to get rid of
you. Your Stella is in the Tombs! Why he
wasn’t killed in that room is more than I know!”</p>

<p>“Because,” replied Nick, with a smile, “they
waited for the arrival of a man who had the nerve
to do the killing, and that man was in the Tombs.”</p>

<p>“This ends the Great Diamond Syndicate,” said
Chick.</p>

<p>“You are mistaken,” cried the chief. “The syndicate
will live on, and will train men to hate Nick
Carter; to murder him.”</p>

<p>The detective smiled and took a package of papers
from his pocket.</p>

<p>“You are wrong again,” he said. “Here are
the records of the syndicate. Not two hours ago
I filed a duplicate with the chief of police. By
this time, every person in New York in any way
connected with the syndicate is either under arrest
or under surveillance. Your game is played
out, gentlemen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>The prisoners were now handcuffed together
and marched off to police headquarters.</p>

<p>“That closes the battle,” cried Chick.</p>

<p>“Not just yet,” replied Nick quietly. “There
are names here that need attention.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, the detective waved the records of
the syndicate in his hand.</p>

<p>“They not only need attention, but they will get
it at once. It has been an interesting game so far.
Now let us push it through to the end. There was
never much mystery concerning the murder. I
could have named the murderer of Townsend
within an hour after viewing his body, but the
girl had to be found before a word was said.
Then came the developments concerning the
Great Diamond Syndicate, and that organization
had to be cleaned up.”</p>

<p>“Why were you so sure of Mantelle after the
interview at the café?” asked Chick. “I know he
rather overdid the thing there, but still I could see
no proof.”</p>

<p>“When I lay on the couch in the rooms of the
syndicate,” replied Nick, “I saw some peculiar
jewelry lying on the chief’s desk. Well, Mantelle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
wore that identical jewelry at the café. I could
not believe it at first, for I did not remember seeing
the chief take the stuff away in the hurry of
his departure.”</p>

<p>“But it was the same?”</p>

<p>“It certainly was. I saw that when I took the
pin and the ring from Mantelle to-night. Well,
you see how that connected him with the syndicate?
And there never was any doubt that the
syndicate was at the bottom of the murder.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.
<br />
<small>THE DEN OF THE SYNDICATE.</small></h2>


<p>“And now what is the layout, Nick?” asked
Chick when the prisoners had been disposed of
and the detectives had returned to Nick’s house.</p>

<p>“To clean out the den of the syndicate.”</p>

<p>“I thought the fire did that.”</p>

<p>“But there is another, where the smaller fry
hang out, as this record shows,” replied Nick
again, referring to the paper. “To be sure, there
are only the little fellows left; but great oaks from
little acorns grow, Chick, and I think we had better
make a clean round-up while we are about it.”</p>

<p>“And what are your plans?”</p>

<p>“You know the Dominion saloon?”</p>

<p>“Sure. It’s a crooked joint, although the police
have never been able to get a line on it.”</p>

<p>“Right you are, Chick. Well, that is the hangout
for the little fellows of the syndicate. I want
you to go there and try and get a job as a waiter,
or helper of some sort. They are always putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
on ‘extras’ there. Get into a good disguise, and I
will join you later.”</p>

<p>Without further parley, Chick went into the
costume room, and within half an hour he was on
his way to the Dominion.</p>

<p>It was some time later when Nick followed him,
also in disguise. He took a cab, and was soon
within a block of the saloon, a resort that was
operated in the interests of one of the toughest
gangs in New York.</p>

<p>Here he dismissed the cab and strolled up to the
place he sought. He did not enter immediately,
however. Pretending to be under the influence of
liquor, he stood for a time in front of the place,
hands in pockets, glancing tipsily at the show
posters in the windows.</p>

<p>A perfect procession of crooks was passing into
the place, and Nick was waiting to attract the attention
of some of them. Presently he had his
wish, for a confidence man known to the crooked
profession as Blister called him to the doorway.</p>

<p>“Hello, there!” cried the crook. “You can’t see
half of the show from the outside. Come in and
have a bracer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>Nick looked up with a drunken dignity which
set the crook laughing.</p>

<p>“I don’t know you,” he said.</p>

<p>“Come in and get acquainted, then,” was the
laughing reply. “What do you expect to get
standing out there looking at the paper lions?
You can see the real thing on the inside. Admission
free! Come and have a snifter.”</p>

<p>“You’re all right!” cried Nick. “I’m choice of
me company, but I’ll have a drink with you.
You’re all right.”</p>

<p>They walked into the place together and took
seats at a table. The room was a large one, and
was well filled with customers. In front was a
cigar stand, shut off from the room proper by a
high screen with mirror panels. Back of this was
a long bar, and all along the side and clustered in
the rear were tables. Just at the end of the bar
an open staircase led to the rooms above.</p>

<p>Sitting at the table with the confidence man,
Nick saw Chick passing up and down the staircase
with beer and wine on trays. The assistant
gave a quick glance at his chief, but did not seem
to recognize him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>Nick does not drink intoxicating liquor, so
when the wine was brought at the command of
the crook, he was seized with a coughing fit, and
succeeded in spilling most of the contents of his
glass.</p>

<p>“We’ll have another,” said the detective, drawing
forth a roll of banknotes, which caused the
eyes of the confidence man to open wide. The fellow
thought that the money was certain to come
his way before the night was over.</p>

<p>Glancing about the room, Nick saw that those
present were gathered in little groups, talking
earnestly and in whispers. They all appeared to
be very well known to each other.</p>

<p>Nick noticed that two muscular fellows kept
near the door.</p>

<p>The confidence man bought several drinks, and
then began talking about a little game that was
going on upstairs.</p>

<p>“I’m going up and play a few stacks,” he said.
“It’s dull down here. You may come along and
look on if you want to. Don’t get into any game
with strangers, however,” he added, “for there
are some pretty tough chaps here to-night. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
you want to play a small game, I’ll get you a seat
at my table after a while.”</p>

<p>Nick was not ready to leave the lower room,
so he put the crook off and sat with his eyes on
the door.</p>

<p>Presently four men entered the place, drank at
the bar, and then started up the staircase. Nick
saw that they were strangers there, judging by
the attitude of the others in the room. They were
tall, broad-shouldered men, and all wore full
beards. It was plain that they were armed.</p>

<p>One of the men behind the bar called to the men
as they started up the staircase.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” he asked, stepping toward
them.</p>

<p>“To the wine room,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Those are private rooms,” said the attendant.
“You can’t go up there to-night.”</p>

<p>The muscular fellows who had been watching
at the door now advanced to the foot of the stairs.
As they did so, four roughly dressed men entered
and stepped back to the inner end of the bar.</p>

<p>“There seems to be a little row on between the
remaining members of the syndicate,” thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
Nick. “Well, when thieves fall out honest men
get their dues.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t we go up?” demanded one of the
men. “We have been there before.”</p>

<p>“Not to-night,” said the attendant. “Take
seats down here.”</p>

<p>The men hesitated. Then they saw that the
people in the place were gathering about them
with threatening looks, and took chairs at a table,
the eight close together.</p>

<p>The crook who was sitting with Nick arose
and moved up to the bar, where he stood whispering
to the man in charge.</p>

<p>As he did so, Chick walked up to Nick as if to
take an order.</p>

<p>“When the row begins,” he said, “go to the
back end of the room. I’ll be there. We’ll go up
by the private staircase. I know where to take
you.”</p>

<p>Nick nodded, and Chick brought two glasses of
wine and placed them on the table.</p>

<p>Before the crook returned to his chair, however,
the rush was made. Nick saw the gang
springing for the stairs, drawing their revolvers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
as they went, and made for the back of the room,
where Chick awaited him.</p>

<p>There came a shot, and in an instant the lights
were out. Then followed more shots on the stairs,
and a police call sounded.</p>

<p>The detective heard the men breaking in the
door at the head of the stairs, and then came
more shooting in the hall above. All was confusion
in the room below.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.
<br />
<small>WHAT NICK OVERHEARD.</small></h2>


<p>As the detectives started up the stairs, which
were not lighted, a woman’s voice came from
above.</p>

<p>“Who is there?” she asked.</p>

<p>Chick crowded past his chief before he replied:</p>

<p>“Waiter.”</p>

<p>“What is going on down there?” was the next
question.</p>

<p>“There’s a gang of toughs making for the wine
rooms.”</p>

<p>There was a short silence, during which the detectives
crept noiselessly up the stairs. In a moment
Nick could feel the woman’s skirt by reaching
over Chick’s shoulders. The gang was not
yet in the hall connecting with the private stairs.</p>

<p>“Send Jim up to my room,” said the woman
presently.</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>The woman was heard moving away, and the
detectives followed her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>She passed down a narrow hall running toward
an annex in the rear of the building. Presently
she opened a door, and the passage was flooded
with light. The electrics in the annex had not
been switched off.</p>

<p>The woman uttered a cry of alarm when she
saw two men were following her, one in the uniform
of a waiter and the other a stranger.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” she demanded.
“Go back and send Jim up. Who is that with
you?”</p>

<p>“Friend,” replied Chick. “Business man, and
I brought him up so he wouldn’t get pinched. Put
him away somewhere.”</p>

<p>Chick made a sly motion toward his pocket.
The woman understood. Many a man had been
robbed in that place.</p>

<p>“I see,” replied the woman. “Bring him in
here.”</p>

<p>She stepped into the room and motioned for
the detectives to follow.</p>

<p>Nick now appeared to be very much intoxicated,
and Chick helped him along. The woman
pointed to a small room at the side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>“Take him in there,” she said, “then go and
call Jim.”</p>

<p>Nick was thinking fast. His first impulse was
to secure the woman against outcry and make for
the front of the building.</p>

<p>As Nick mused, studying out the problem, another
woman’s voice was heard in the room he had
first entered. The door between the two rooms
was open, and he heard the newcomer saying:</p>

<p>“This will end the business for the whole
crowd. Idle police are out there with guns and
night sticks. I guess the whole place will be
pinched. They can’t get in here, however. Everything
safe?”</p>

<p>There was no reply that Nick could hear, but
the woman was evidently warned that a stranger
was in the next room, for she began speaking in
whispers. Nick began to snore loudly.</p>

<p>“Asleep,” whispered the woman.</p>

<p>“Drunk,” said the other, “and he has a roll as
big as a stovepipe.”</p>

<p>Nick leaned back in his chair with his eyes shut,
but he knew that the women were standing in the
doorway looking him over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wonder why Jim doesn’t come?” asked the
woman who had admitted Nick to the room. “I
sent a waiter after him.”</p>

<p>“I presume he is busy,” was the reply. “There
is a big fight on out there.”</p>

<p>“What is it all about?”</p>

<p>“Why, the gang believes that Hughart squealed
to Carter, and caused the arrest of the big chief.
They want him.”</p>

<p>“But he didn’t.”</p>

<p>“That’s true enough, but you can’t make the
gang believe it.”</p>

<p>Nick began to wait with impatience for the return
of Chick.</p>

<p>There was now no shooting in front, but a good
deal of running around was heard, and doors
were slamming, as if a general search or chase
was on.</p>

<p>Fretting over his enforced inactivity, Nick decided
to try a new plan. With a loud snort he fell
from his chair, and lay like a log on the floor.</p>

<p>One of the women came to the doorway.</p>

<p>“The drunken brute!” she cried. “We must
throw him into the back room.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>Acting on this suggestion, the women seized
Nick and dragged him over a doorsill, and left
him. Then he heard a door close.</p>

<p>Opening his eyes cautiously, he found himself
in utter darkness. The room was undoubtedly an
inside one, for no windows were in sight.</p>

<p>He arose to his feet in order to get his bearings,
if possible. As he did so, the room was flooded
with light from electric globes far up on the wall,
and a voice said:</p>

<p>“You awoke suddenly.”</p>

<p>It was the voice of one of the women who had
been talking while he sat in the next room. Nick
looked about. There was no one in sight.</p>

<p>“Sit down in that chair in the middle of the
room,” commanded the voice. “You will be shot
if you try any of your games.”</p>

<p>To say that Nick was disgusted with himself
but feebly expresses his feelings. At the critical
moment he had permitted a woman to outwit him!</p>

<p>“I am not in the killing business myself,” said
the woman, “but there will soon be a person here
who has no scruples in getting rid of spies and
murderers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>Nick took the chair without a word. His hope
was now in Chick.</p>

<p>“You’re after Hughart, are you?” she asked.</p>

<p>“You know what we want,” replied Nick.
“Why not make it an even thing for both sides?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you want to compromise, do you?”
sneered the woman. “That bum waiter you
sneaked in here got his a moment ago. And the
rest of your crowd has just been taken away by
the police.”</p>

<p>The detective did not believe this. There was
still too much excitement at the front of the
building.</p>

<p>Presently the noise grew louder, seeming to
come from the room in which Chick had left him.
Then the lights were shut off, and again he was
in darkness.</p>

<p>He heard the sounds of a struggle, but had no
means of knowing whether it was the police or
the syndicate gang. Then came a shout:</p>

<p>“Kick in the doors, boys. He is here somewhere.”</p>

<p>This was followed by heavy blows, and a door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
fell with a crash. Then another, and in a second
the door to the room where he sat was attacked.</p>

<p>He sprang to a corner of the room and waited,
his revolver ready at his hand.</p>

<p>When the door fell, three men bounded into the
room. They were not policemen, but members
of the syndicate.</p>

<p>One of the men advanced toward Nick.</p>

<p>“Here he is,” he shouted. “Now, hurry up. It’s
a fight to get out, I suppose.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.
<br />
<small>A DESPERATE RAID.</small></h2>


<p>Nick was dragged to the square of light in
front of the open doorway. He appeared to be
still under the influence of liquor.</p>

<p>The men regarded him with rage and dismay,
holding him fast in the meantime.</p>

<p>“This is not the man we want,” one of them
shouted.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” demanded another.</p>

<p>Sounds of advancing footsteps were now heard
from the direction of the private staircase.</p>

<p>“Quick!” cried one of the men, seizing Nick by
the throat. “Is there any way out of this cursed
hole? The cops are after us.”</p>

<p>“They brought me here to rob me,” faltered the
detective, “and I can’t find the way out.”</p>

<p>“Some cheap sport,” cried one of the gang.
“Come on, boys!”</p>

<p>But Nick had no idea of permitting the men
to escape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>He had no way of knowing how many members
of the gang had been taken by the police, but
he was determined that these three should not get
away.</p>

<p>He knew that in such dens as he then found
himself there were often double doors, the second
one of metal and sliding down from the upper
casing.</p>

<p>The Dominion had for years been the resort of
thieves and murderers, and it would not be
strange if something of the kind should exist
in the room where, he had no doubt, many persons
had been shot from the secret panel from
which he had been threatened.</p>

<p>In fact, the very presence of the secret panel
convinced him that the room was not protected by
only a wooden door.</p>

<p>If anything of the sort existed, there should
be a push button on the outer casing.</p>

<p>He was already in the doorway, where he had
been thrust by the gang for close inspection, and
before they could move out he made a quick examination.</p>

<p>The button was there, and he stepped outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
and pressed it. As he expected, a metal door slid
from above and covered the opening. The women
had been too sure of him to use the door, and had
been too excited to think of it when the gang
arrived.</p>

<p>As the metal door shot down, Nick saw Chick
in the room behind him, but he disappeared in an
instant, much to the amazement of the detective.
Then a familiar voice came from beyond the
door:</p>

<p>“Throw up your hands in there! I have you
covered!”</p>

<p>Then Nick remembered that Chick had informed
him that he was thoroughly posted regarding
the Dominion. The means used to trap
victims was now being used in the interest of
the law.</p>

<p>Chick was there at the secret panel. Nick wondered
if the outlaws were obeying orders.</p>

<p>He looked about for some way of reaching
Chick, and saw a door at the left of the metal one.
Opening this, the detective found himself in a
narrow hallway, at the end of which stood his assistant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
with two revolvers pointing through the
little opening.</p>

<p>“You’re a brick,” cried Nick. “What are they
doing?”</p>

<p>“Holding up their hands,” was the grim reply.</p>

<p>“Hold them a moment,” said Nick.</p>

<p>He stepped back to the room where he had left
the women.</p>

<p>“Where are the police?” asked the detective.</p>

<p>“Sending crooks in by wagon loads,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>“Oh, you are detectives, are you?” said one of
the women. Then she turned to Nick.</p>

<p>“I would have killed you had I known,” she said
angrily.</p>

<p>“By the way,” said Nick, addressing the
woman, “you may as well tell us where you have
hidden Hughart.”</p>

<p>“I know nothing about any such man,” came
the scornful reply. “The boys will be back here
soon, and then you will get what’s coming to you.”</p>

<p>“The police are in charge of the place.”</p>

<p>“But they didn’t get here in time,” sneered the
woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>This meant, if it meant anything, that Hughart
had gotten away before the raid, or while it was
in progress.</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure of that,” was his reply.</p>

<p>“The police would never have thought of coming
here,” stormed the woman. “It remained for
you to come sneaking in like a man ashamed of
himself.”</p>

<p>Nick had learned what he wanted to know.
The police were in charge of the front part of the
building, and were not likely to come there unless
sent for. The crooks were scattered or under arrest,
and the crooks had made themselves scarce,
at least those who remained at liberty had.</p>

<p>There was now no danger of his being disturbed
in carrying out the plans he had decided
upon. Taking a position at the panel, he asked:</p>

<p>“Now who has the top hand?”</p>

<p>The crooks swore volubly, and Nick laughed.</p>

<p>“I’m coming in there now to disarm you,” said
Nick, “but I leave a chap here who can do pretty
good shooting. The man who resists will be
killed.” Then, turning to Chick, he asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>“How many pair of handcuffs have you?”</p>

<p>“Two, but——”</p>

<p>“Never mind that,” interrupted Nick. “You
stay here and shoot if one of them lifts a finger.
I’ll lock the women in a closet.”</p>

<p>This plan was adopted, and in five minutes the
three crooks were disarmed and handcuffed.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you’re a New York policeman,”
said one of the men, glaring at Nick. “They don’t
do things in this way. We have been operating
here quite a time, and this is our first experience
of this kind.”</p>

<p>“You are not discreet,” smiled Nick as he handcuffed
them.</p>

<p>The sound of angry words now came from the
room where Chick had been left in charge of the
two prisoners and the women.</p>

<p>Nick opened the door and looked out. A
heavily built man with a mustache dyed black and
an evil face was shaking a huge fist at the women.</p>

<p>“You’ve robbed me,” he was saying, “and I
now give you in charge of these officers. You
saw your chance when things were getting mixed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
and took every dollar from the safe. You’re nice
people, you are.”</p>

<p>The women looked the man over scornfully and
maintained a discreet silence.</p>

<p>The tough turned to Nick.</p>

<p>“I remember you,” he said. “You came into
the place to-night just before the raid, and you
made for this room when the row started. That
man there,” pointing to Chick, “hired out as a
waiter early in the evening. You are detectives,
I suppose?”</p>

<p>“You have guessed it,” replied Chick.</p>

<p>“Well, I want you to arrest these women. They
have robbed the safe of ten thousand dollars. I
will appear against them.”</p>

<p>“When was this money taken?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“Some time during the evening.”</p>

<p>“But the women have been here ever since the
row started.”</p>

<p>“Then they took the money before that time.
They might have taken it during the afternoon,
for all I know. They had chances enough if they
knew the combination, and they must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
learned that, or they could not have taken it at
all, for the safe was locked.”</p>

<p>“Where is the safe?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“In a little room at the back end of the saloon.”</p>

<p>“Near the private staircase?”</p>

<p>“Close to it.”</p>

<p>“Is your name Jim?” asked the detective.</p>

<p>“Not for a minute,” was the reply. “Jim is the
bartender.”</p>

<p>Nick glanced at the women. They threw him
an appealing glance and turned their eyes away.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he took the money,” suggested Nick.</p>

<p>“He wasn’t here until just before the row began,”
was the reply.</p>

<p>“Where is he now?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. The police closed the place.”</p>

<p>As the fellow spoke he glared angrily at the
prisoners. It was evident that he knew something
of the cause of the raid.</p>

<p>“These men came here,” said Nick, “looking
for a man named Hughart. Where is Hughart?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about him,” was the
angry reply. “What I want now is my money,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
and I want these women and these rooms
searched.”</p>

<p>“Search them, then,” said Nick. “You know
the rooms better than we do.”</p>

<p>“We can look through the rooms later, after
the women are taken away,” said the proprietor,
“but I want the women searched now. I believe
they have my money on their persons.”</p>

<p>“They will be searched at headquarters,” replied
the detective.</p>

<p>“Well,” continued the enraged owner of the
place, “if you have done your work here, I want
you to get out. I must get things in shape again.”</p>

<p>The women flushed painfully when they heard
the mention of police headquarters.</p>

<p>“I never took his money,” one of them said.
“I don’t believe he ever had the sum he mentions.”</p>

<p>“I am willing to be searched now,” said the
other.</p>

<p>“Speaking of this Hughart,” said the proprietor,
“Molly, that woman there,” pointing to the
one Nick desired to question closely in time; “that
woman Molly is the one who had the scheme on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
with him. She knows where he is if any one
does.”</p>

<p>“Where was she last night?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“I don’t know where she was. She was not
seen about the place.”</p>

<p>“I was in my room,” replied Molly.</p>

<p>“I know better,” declared the proprietor. “You
were out all evening. Come, now, you dig down
and produce that money, or I’ll send you over the
road.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t got your money,” declared Molly.
“And when it comes to talk about sending me over
the road, that is a game two can play at. You had
better be careful what you say and do, Ben Hall.
If you accuse me of taking your money, I’ll get
even with you, and you may depend upon it.”</p>

<p>Angry as he was over his loss, Hall hesitated.</p>

<p>“I may be mistaken,” he said finally, turning to
Nick. “I think I was a little hasty. If you’ll give
me a chance to talk with Molly alone, I think we
can fix it up.”</p>

<p>“Not at present,” was Nick’s reply. Then he
added: “You do not accuse the other woman?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>“Carrie? No. Carrie’s all right. I don’t know
as Molly took the money, but it looks suspicious.”</p>

<p>“Then there is nothing to hold Carrie for?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing, and you may as well release
Molly, too. We can square our little matter between
ourselves.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to hold Molly,” said Nick.</p>

<p>Molly looked disappointed. In a moment she
turned and whispered to Carrie, taking good care
that not a word should be overheard. She spoke
rapidly, and Carrie nodded now and then to show
that she understood.</p>

<p>“What is all this talk about?” demanded Hall.</p>

<p>“I’m sending her after a lawyer and a bondsman,
and after my laundry,” replied Molly, with
warmth. “You don’t think I’m going to remain
in jail, do you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll attend to that,” said Hall.</p>

<p>“Indeed you won’t,” said the woman. “You’ve
got your foot in it now, and you’ll kindly let me
alone. I’ll attend to you later.”</p>

<p>“What have I said?” asked Hall.</p>

<p>“You said I was mixed up in the scheme to
throw down the chief. I wasn’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, you were,” roared Hall; “and the boys
think you are trying to throw them down. You
can’t square yourself with them very easily, I can
tell you that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care what the boys think,” said Molly.</p>

<p>“Where were you this afternoon, Molly?”
asked Nick.</p>

<p>“Right here.”</p>

<p>“All the time?”</p>

<p>“I never left the place. I have been here all
day.”</p>

<p>Nick turned to his assistant.</p>

<p>“Take the men away,” he said. “Be careful
how you handle them, for they are a bad lot.
See them locked up at headquarters, and then return.”</p>

<p>“That looks like you wanted these rooms for
an office,” grunted Hall.</p>

<p>“And when you get to the street,” continued
Nick, turning to Chick, “send two policemen here
to guard these rooms. Station them at the outer
door there.”</p>

<p>Hall turned away with an oath and went back
to his wrecked barroom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>After a short talk with his chief, which was not
heard by the others, Chick went away with the
prisoners.</p>

<p>Nick waited until the policeman arrived; then,
leaving Carrie in charge of one of them, he called
Molly aside.</p>

<p>“Where is Hall’s money?” he asked.</p>

<p>The angry woman refused to answer. Nor
would she tell anything about the whereabouts of
Hughart.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.
<br />
<small>NICK TAKES A CHANCE.</small></h2>


<p>Finally there came a knock on the door. Nick
opened it and looked out. Chick stood there.</p>

<p>“They are landed, all right,” he said.</p>

<p>Nick drew him aside.</p>

<p>“In five minutes’ time,” he said, “release Carrie,
and see that she leaves by the side door of the
saloon. I will be there to pick her up. Then leave
the policemen here to guard these rooms, and take
Molly to the house. This place may have to be
searched later.”</p>

<p>“Unless I am very much mistaken,” said Chick,
“a couple of those crooks are watching about the
place. You may have company if you follow
Carrie.”</p>

<p>“So much the better,” replied Nick.</p>

<p>Five minutes later Carrie emerged from the
side door of the saloon and turned toward the
East River. At the same time a man in a modest
suit of dark brown whirled into the side street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
and moved along rapidly, whistling and swinging
a cane as he walked. Two men standing across
the street followed along in the shadows.</p>

<p>The detective’s disguise was a good one. He
had turned his reversible suit, removed his false
mustache, washed the convivial red from his
cheeks, and lined his face just a trifle, in order to
make himself look older and thinner. No one
who had seen him at Hall’s place would have recognized
him now.</p>

<p>He passed Carrie at a swinging pace and
turned at the next corner. There he waited in
a convenient doorway for her to pass. As she did
so, the two men crossed to the north side of the
street, upon which the girl was walking, and followed
on behind her. Nick crossed to the south
side of the street, and walked along in silence,
keeping abreast of the girl.</p>

<p>“This is rather a chestnut,” he mused, “releasing
a suspect and following after, and Carrie may
not go to Hughart. Yet she is not a very wise
person, and I am sure that Molly told her to communicate
with him.”</p>

<p>Nick knew very well that the two men who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
were following the girl were on the same mission
as himself. The gang had not yet given up the
notion of finding Hughart. They had shown both
nerve and cunning in the game, as far as it had
been played, and he looked for some unusual developments
from them before the night was over.</p>

<p>Their presence complicated matters, but the detective
could only follow on and take chances
when the time came.</p>

<p>After walking several blocks, Carrie entered
an all-night restaurant not far from the river, and
seated herself at a table. From the opposite side
of the street, Nick saw the trailers peering
through the windows of the place, evidently in
doubt as to the advisability of entering.</p>

<p>Carrie ordered a cup of coffee and a sandwich.
The waiter who brought them remained at the
table for a moment, and then talked briefly with
a sporty-looking fellow who sat behind the desk,
apparently the cashier.</p>

<p>Nick sauntered in and took a stool at the lunch
counter, not far from the table where the girl sat.
As he did so, the cashier approached the girl and
opened a whispered conversation with her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’d better cut it all out,” Nick heard him
say. “According to your own story, things are
getting mixed.”</p>

<p>Carrie whispered something which the detective
could not hear. Then the cashier said:</p>

<p>“Like a wild man. Getting tired of waiting, I
guess.”</p>

<p>Another whisper from the girl.</p>

<p>“No, he has not been down here. Afraid, I
guess. You keep out of it.”</p>

<p>The girl bent closer, and whispered at length.</p>

<p>“I’ll take the message,” said the cashier next.</p>

<p>Nick paid his bill and left the place. The two
watchers were still on the opposite side of the
street.</p>

<p>As soon as Nick passed the square of light in
front of the restaurant, he turned into a stairway
which led to the upper part of the building, which
was only three stories in height and without an
elevator. The hallway was not lighted, and, as
soon as the detective stepped inside, he was in
darkness, broken only by a dim light coming
through a transom over a door connecting with
the restaurant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>Turning to look back, he saw that the watchers
were crossing the street. Fearful that they might
seek shelter in the stairway and so discover him,
Nick passed on to the first landing. There was a
dim light here, but the transoms above the doors
showed that the rooms opening from the hall were
in darkness.</p>

<p>He passed on up the second flight of stairs, and
found himself in a narrow hallway with a window
at each end. Lights showed in all the four rooms
on that floor.</p>

<p>Nick went to the back window and looked out.
There was a fire escape there, and he stepped out
and hung to the rungs, his head on a level with
the windowsill. The windows of the rear room
were open, and the detective heard voices. They
did not appear to come from that room, however,
but from an inner one next to it.</p>

<p>The fire escape was available from the windows
of the back room, and Nick moved along and
looked in. As he suspected, there was no one
there. He could not see into the inner room, for
the door was not in line with the window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>There was, however, a door in line—the door
of a closet, and this was ajar.</p>

<p>“It is up to me to take a chance,” muttered
Nick, and in a second he was in the room making
for the closet.</p>

<p>Before he reached the place of shelter, however,
a figure appeared in the doorway connecting
with the inner room. Then a man sprang forward.
In an instant Nick had his revolver leveled.</p>

<p>“I have been looking for you, Mr. Hughart,”
Nick said coolly. “You may as well come with
me.”</p>

<p>Then a woman’s scream came from the inner
room, and Carrie appeared in the doorway. She
had gained the room by means of a stairway from
the restaurant.</p>

<p>The detective confronted the pair with his
threatening revolver.</p>

<p>“Not a word,” he said. “Come! We want you,
Hughart.”</p>

<p>“What for?” demanded the miner.</p>

<p>“You’ll learn that in time,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“And if I refuse to go?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then you will be taken by force.”</p>

<p>Then Nick scented danger. He saw the eyes
of the pair travel past him and fix themselves on
the door leading to the hall.</p>

<p>It is an old trick to place a person off guard, but
this looked real to the detective. The terror in
Hughart’s eyes was not simulated.</p>

<p>Without lowering his weapon, Nick turned
about. He was too late. As he did so, a noose
fell over his shoulders.</p>

<p>The rope was drawn taut, with the detective’s
hands and arms between it and his body.</p>

<p>Hughart and the girl sprang for the inner
room as the rope fell, but one of the men, gun
in hand, barred the way.</p>

<p>“Well, Hughart,” he said viciously, “it has
come to a show-down at last.”</p>

<p>“What do you want?” demanded the miner.</p>

<p>“We want you.”</p>

<p>Hughart made a sudden spring for the man,
avoided the shot, and grappled him. The man
who had been guarding Nick sprang forward to
help his companion, and in a second the detective
was out of the rope and in the fight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the second man could draw his gun,
Nick landed a heavy blow on the jaw which sent
him to the floor like a dead man.</p>

<p>Hughart was fighting like a madman, but
would have been bested had the detective not
hastened to his assistance, settling the outlaw
with a terrific blow.</p>

<p>Hughart gazed at the detective in amazement.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.
<br />
<small>BULLY COMES TO GRIEF.</small></h2>


<p>“That was quick work,” said Hughart, “but I
did not expect to see you helping me.”</p>

<p>“I had an idea,” replied the detective, “that I
wanted a little of your society myself, and so do
the police.”</p>

<p>“Who’s talkin’ about the police?” said a voice,
and the next moment a burly man appeared in the
doorway of the inner room.</p>

<p>He was almost a giant, and carried himself
with the air of a fighter. The muscles on his
arms and neck stood out like cords, and there was
an ugly leer on his face.</p>

<p>“I am talking about the police,” replied Nick.</p>

<p>“Go chase yourself,” thundered the bouncer,
“you can’t bring no police up here while I’m
around.”</p>

<p>Nick saw that there was trouble ahead, and got
ready for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>Hughart turned away.</p>

<p>“Wait,” said Nick. “You are going with me as
soon as these men are taken care of.”</p>

<p>“He don’t have to go unless he wants to,”
sneered the bouncer. “You can’t come up here
an’ run this place.”</p>

<p>Hughart turned back, and said:</p>

<p>“I have no idea of going with you. You helped
me out here, a moment ago, and I thank you for
that, but here our ways part.”</p>

<p>Nick was in rather a tight box, for he did not
know but the crooks might regain consciousness
in a minute and come to the assistance of the
bully.</p>

<p>Whatever was done must be done at once.</p>

<p>He turned to Hughart.</p>

<p>“You are wanted as a witness in the case
against the chief of the diamond syndicate,” he
said, “and you may as well come along without
making trouble.”</p>

<p>“The diamond syndicate?” echoed the miner.
“What do I know about a diamond syndicate?”</p>

<p>“You know all about it,” replied Nick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>“This is the first I have heard of it,” said the
man, a look of fear on his face.</p>

<p>It was easy to see that the man was lying.</p>

<p>“He’s givin’ you guff,” roared the bouncer.
“Shall I put him out?”</p>

<p>Nick was getting angry. The developments
of the night had convinced the detective that
Hughart would make trouble if an attempt to
take him by force was made.</p>

<p>“Get out!” roared the bouncer. “Don’t be
kicking up a row here.”</p>

<p>Nick stepped backward to the door opening
into the hall, and gave a shrill call on his police
whistle.</p>

<p>In a second the bouncer was making for him,
not with a weapon, but with his brawny fists,
which had doubtless put more than one man out
of business.</p>

<p>Nick met him halfway. The fellow put up his
hands in prize-ring style, but it was of little avail.
Nick is a past master in the art of boxing, and the
bouncer went to the floor to join the crooks.</p>

<p>Then Nick found himself threatened with a revolver
in the hands of Hughart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl screamed and covered her face with
her hands. Hughart turned for a second to warn
her against making an outcry, and that was
enough. He went down under a crashing blow.</p>

<p>Carrie gave a scream of fright and anger as
Hughart fell, and turned toward the inner stairs
leading to the restaurant.</p>

<p>“It looks like a slaughterhouse,” she said.</p>

<p>And, indeed, she was not far from right. There
were four men on the floor whom the detective
had put out of business for the time being. He
smiled as he thought what would have resulted
had they all attacked him at once.</p>

<p>“Wait until the police come,” said Nick to the
girl. “You are to go with me.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I’m not,” was the angry reply. “I was
arrested once to-day, and they were glad to let
me go.”</p>

<p>“Where do you wish to go?” asked Nick. “Do
you want to communicate the news to your friend
Molly, who sent you here?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you are talking about?”
said the girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come, come,” said Nick, “I am the officer who
had you under arrest up at Hall’s place. You
were released in order that you might show the
way to Hughart’s hiding place. Molly, by the
way, has been taken to my house, and you can
see her there.”</p>

<p>The girl stepped back in wonder.</p>

<p>“You must be Nick Carter,” she said. “No
other man could so disguise himself and do what
you have done here.”</p>

<p>“The same, at your service,” replied Nick, with
a laugh.</p>

<p>“Then I suppose I’ll have to go with you,” said
the girl, “but you won’t get anything out
of me.”</p>

<p>Presently the police came—two patrolmen who
had heard the whistle.</p>

<p>Nick made himself known, told them to see that
the crooks were taken to police headquarters, and
asked one of them to call a carriage.</p>

<p>Hughart was still unconscious from the blow
he had received, and had to be carried to the
vehicle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>“You gave him a good one,” grinned one of the
officers.</p>

<p>“It was that or nothing,” replied Nick. “See
that these men are safely handcuffed and locked
up. When the wagon comes, one of you remain
here and close the place.”</p>

<p>The officer pointed to the bouncer.</p>

<p>“What about this one?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Lock him up,” was the brief reply. “There
are plenty of charges to make against him. He’s
a tough, but not so tough as he thinks he is.”</p>

<p>Arrived at Nick’s house, Hughart and Carrie
were placed in separate rooms. The latter at
once asked for Molly, but was not permitted to see
her at that time. Hughart was beginning to show
signs of consciousness.</p>

<p>Chick appeared as Nick entered his study.</p>

<p>“You are making quite a collection to-night,”
he said. “Molly is making things hum in that little
room.”</p>

<p>“What does she say?”</p>

<p>“That you shall be made to suffer for her detention.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is cheerful,” said Nick. “Has she been
searched?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Mrs. Knight left her not long ago.”</p>

<p>“She found the money?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry for the woman,” mused Nick.
“She is in bad shape just now.”</p>

<p>Although Hughart had been suspected, without
cause, by his companions in the syndicate, under
Nick Carter’s third degree he confessed everything,
with the result that the detective was able
to make a strong case against the gang.</p>

<p>“The small fry,” as Nick called them, it was
proven had nothing to do with the murder, and
all escaped with sentences ranging from ten to
twenty years.</p>

<p>Bernice escaped the penalty of the law by committing
suicide in her cell.</p>

<p>The chief of the diamond thieves, Anton, and
Stella went to the electric chair.</p>

<p>The large diamonds which had been removed
from the Maynard collection by Bernice were
never found. After rounding up the syndicate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
Nick refused to engage in a hunt for the diamonds.</p>

<p>The case was fairly won, but the famous detective
declares to this day that the cleverest criminals
he ever encountered belonged to the Great
Diamond Syndicate.</p>

<p class="p2">There has been a big demand for outdoor stories, and a very
considerable portion of it has been for the Maxwell Stevens
stories about Jack Lightfoot, the athlete.</p>

<p>These stories are of interest to old and young. They are
not, strictly speaking, stories for boys, but boys everywhere
will find a great deal in them to engage their interest.</p>

<p>The Jack Lightfoot stories deal with every branch of sport—baseball,
football, rowing, swimming, racing, tennis, and every
sort of occupation, both indoor and out, that the healthy-minded
man turns to.</p>

<p class="p2 no-indent">who handles the STREET &amp; SMITH NOVELS

<p>He has looked into the question of the morality

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
